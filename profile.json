The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-04-29T22:06:31.591198Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3844373,"followers":2417,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc","DretS191","WdbHS4uT","elFOHmh9","R7WWpY0Z","G8Aq3OEv","WTCAdLsq","MJUxq3kq","LXUa8bFw","h61Z2iVZ","dLAG06tP","CL7AHQsm","HHrwznjQ","XNQUud9H","rsM9VY0D","bovSU7Mt","EkAJiIZH","lALu7fvN","TD5Fv92S"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"EkAJiIZH","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"YetAnotherConfigLib 3.4.2 for MC 1.20.4","version_number":"3.4.2+1.20.4-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.4.2\n\nThis build supports the following versions:\n- Fabric 1.20.1\n- Fabric 1.20.4\n- Fabric 1.20.5\n- Forge 1.20.1\n- NeoForge 1.20.4\n- NeoForge 1.20.5\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix YACL breaking fabric reload listener dependency order\n\n## Translation Updates\n\n- Added colour picker translations for Tatar ([#174](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/174))\n\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-29T22:06:25.594595Z","downloads":94175,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e2c0109f6f048b1e107e3df48c69fe4a314b994f937f856add21a13072b3a770a2c0151dc9db46647653ac7cdeceb6120a38cc7ca6627a3c42769c901cb9118d","sha1":"a67986e7683bb6e5e71c55911b1badbb6d0d7c4c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/versions/EkAJiIZH/YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.2%2B1.20.4-fabric.jar","filename":"YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.2+1.20.4-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":1073637,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nwpe87D0","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.2+1.20.4-fabric.jar"},"mods\\Highlighter-1.20.2-fabric-1.1.9.jar":{"sha512":"4602c4d178d119ae58d2bda35af6fd974668e7934a9da39a8e30da0ca668a0c20d8d8d11988c718d5b05eb57a7f8f00cb4b567a68a4b2d2e187b187f44ba33e9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"cVNW5lr6","slug":"item-highlighter","project_type":"mod","team":"DbFpDzeZ","title":"Item Highlighter","description":"Highlights newly picked-up items.

However, the potion icons will only work if the server has the mod aswell, and has potion icons enabled in the config\n\n### Will you support X version?\n\nI only ever really intend to support the following versions: 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.3+\n\nIf someone is willing to port the mod to another version and submit a PR, I can upload it for that version too\n\n### Is X feature configurable?\n\nYes. Almost everything is configurable in this mod, right inside the config.\n\n### Can you add X feature?\n\nMaybe!

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

usage optimizations","body":"This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-05-01T06:08:18.836384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":5257709,"followers":5079,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"pguEMpy9","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.3 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.3-fabric","changelog":"- Update to Minecraft 1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-13T09:52:24.527613Z","downloads":846403,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f2bbb773f4213d36201b76820f206e2a6f213c0c","sha512":"709ab6362dd1dcc432edd1e6c33aafba6f2d12be701bc14911107340f8ac2466779c4e57d8a303f0350c46478f23008e6eeca78e4eadedd0bdee63d4ae72ed9a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/pguEMpy9/ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125100,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar"},"mods\\appleskin-fabric-mc1.20.3-2.5.1.jar":{"sha512":"d121c5b760da0df1882f74bedfe84f2033d81a679cb0aa15e38eeae5fefefba8b23b1a87e43095c3cb9cbde5d0960b52d99856209111069923078c39c8750aa6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"EsAfCjCV","slug":"appleskin","project_type":"mod","team":"2RI7njA8","title":"AppleSkin","description":"Food/hunger-related HUD improvements","body":"Adds various food-related HUD improvements.

You get this when first loading into a world, and can also make a new one by Right-Clicking Gleaming Ore with a book.\n\n⠀\n\n\n## Quick Walkthrough of some of the more notable items:\n\n![Displacement Tome](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/347/390/displacement_tome.png)\n\nThe Displacement Tome is an item inspired by Warp Book and it's many clones that allows you to teleport to up to 8 locations and uses Ender Pearls as fuel.\nIt is very expensive in a semi-vanilla context, in bigger modpacks it would need to be balanced though\n\n⠀\n\n![Bater Wucket](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/347/392/bater_wucket.png)\n\nThe Bater Wucket is an infinite water bucket. That's it\n\n⠀\n\n![Ender Pouch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/347/391/ender_pouch.png)\n\nThe Ender Pouch is a portable Ender Chest accessed through a Keybind\n\n⠀\n\n![Enchanted Wax Gland](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/347/393/wax_gland.png)\n\nThe Enchanted Wax Gland is inspired by Trinkets and Bauble's Stone of the Sea. It makes you float in water and also gives a great speed boost.\nYou can also combine with another item to even make it work in Lava!","published":"2021-03-13T09:47:11.061816Z","updated":"2024-02-17T13:19:43.819030Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":274049,"followers":344,"categories":["equipment","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18-pre7","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["kOn8wgLL","Gjy2hRRp","P4iczGyZ","jGApw7GI","v1NNiIOR","VOqULSIT","AuiDnvot","fE8OnXjb","qppeSM50","sM3q1HIY","zNxkbypO","NehU58tH","274i8nNb","I8vCqyHv","UVtm0Mxh","mm11P6PF","FVZaNtjN","ylZli2mA","vL9nY4fj","uJF4YTXl","e2ysxVmj","jXfKOjlw","ubtF4UL9","20KpxXrW","YvuNpDEz","Dwis6LWU","K59hNxSI","3uTXDKXz","XoKlERtL","4osKFK3P","ahg5pbDR","FLzUUyOd","V4qx9x2b","HVxIuUjc","FjkRTLT9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VzAGdu9D/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"FjkRTLT9","project_id":"VzAGdu9D","author_id":"qGOpk8Hs","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.3+] Things - 0.3.4","version_number":"0.3.4+1.20.3","changelog":"## Additions\n- The new **Bempty Ucket** is a counterpart to the Bater Wucket which allows picking up (and thereby voiding) infinite amounts of any fluid (#85)\n- The Recall Potion brewing recipe is now configurable (#86)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-17T13:19:45.309228Z","downloads":7303,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"89f8a01a0d7281ebd2f7e42d4c4dba3dd669e5c09acf610964876b03f71c4788b3691a11b09bdd6af63a1766967b5ce6d8aaca8b96b04a76c099495da1767e15","sha1":"a5516bc3eb37f34ca47b03e7a47fa7f26802708b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VzAGdu9D/versions/FjkRTLT9/things-0.3.4%2B1.20.3.jar","filename":"things-0.3.4+1.20.3.jar","primary":true,"size":1013011,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"98054c5daf8f28d4706722121ace22802ec1ce185e86482a2b808c69a4cace1cef2f8b97c02dc5ebdda2ef06203d22af1bb8d213e5650dc5075dd1fe237c114e","sha1":"e67b25a9e4371cd520f554a1eecd8cae48547a3a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VzAGdu9D/versions/FjkRTLT9/things-0.3.4%2B1.20.3-sources.jar","filename":"things-0.3.4+1.20.3-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":374397,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"5aaWibi9","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"D5h9NKNI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ccKDOlHs","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"74v9cMUx","user":{"id":"qGOpk8Hs","username":"glisco","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15788224?v=4","bio":"she/her | creative director & tech lead\n@ Wisp Forest (https://github.com/wisp-forest)\n\n","created":"2021-03-13T09:39:29.068275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Author","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"things-0.3.4+1.20.3.jar"},"mods\\Boat-Item-View-Fabric-1.20.1-0.0.5.jar":{"sha512":"f38bddc133cdc681932c6c8adfa31c71a57f2174a703880c70649f8db5fc01573fdd247c865801ebd6daf7f49ec5b63bc86334a83533526efae5f61113fe7f15","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"BdKIyOLe","slug":"boat-item-view","project_type":"mod","team":"7tGFU5S6","title":"Boat Item View","description":"See your held items when in a moving boat!","body":"# Boat Item View\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6s5Kpa6.gif\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"403\" height=\"192\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"250\" height=\"192\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n\n## About\n\nThe Boat Item View Mod is a client-side only Minecraft Mod that allows the player to see the item held in their hand while riding in a boat.\n\nThis is functionality is normally not possible in the base game.\n \n\nNote: Any items being displayed in the hand when the boat is moving still cannot be used.

Some items are water sensitive and only turn off or on inside water.\nAdditionally, all enchanted items will emit light level 6 while some enchants under certain conditions emit light level 9.  \nFor a detailed overview of all supported items and entities, take a look at the wiki pages linked below.\n\nThis data pack/mod is completely server-side, but can also be installed on the client only for single-player worlds!\n\n[-> For a detailed overview and available settings, take a look at the wiki <-](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/dynamiclights/wiki)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThis data pack is also available as a mod with an additional global config file and settings menu when installed alongside [MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib).\n\nDecide if you want to download the pack as a pure data pack [DP] or packaged as a mod [Mod]. <br>\nPut the pure data pack .zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world, or the mod into your `.minecraft/mods` folder.\n\n\n## Manage\n\nTo open the ingame menu, execute `/trigger tschipcraft.menu` or `/function #tschipcraft:menu`. There is a **Reset** and an **Uninstall** button.\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\n<img title=\"Supported Minecraft versions\" src=\"https://tschipcraft.ddns.net/mod_resources/supported/supported.php?untested_versions=1.22&supported_versions=1.17,1.18,1.19,1.20&total_versions=%3C=1.13,1.14,1.15,1.16,1.17,1.18,1.19,1.20,1.21&progress_bar=false&mc_background=false&icons=true&platform=modrinth\">\n\nThis data pack follows the [Smithed](https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/) and essential [MC Datapacks Discord Server](https://mc-datapacks.github.io/en/conventions/index.html) Conventions to ensure data pack compatibility.\n\nSome sophisticated redstone contraptions may not work when this project is installed, since the light block is not pushable for some reason.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-05-25T20:34:39.856745Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6129693,"followers":4948,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"7JR5qJ8f","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":false,"name":"1.6.4-1.20.4 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.4-1.20.4","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Fix culling when the camera is stuck in a wall.

This attack can be blocked, but be warned, it will eat through your shield quickly!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Drowned</summary>\nIn addition to the default zombie dash/bite, drowned get the following two changes:\n\n- Drowned swim faster now, on top of the default movement buff for all mobs.\n- If a player is above water, drowned will periodically pull them deeper underwater in an attempt to, well, drown them. This can even happen if you are traveling above them in a boat. Watch out for hordes!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Elder Guardians</summary>\nElder guardians have been upgraded to be full fledged boss mobs.\n\n- Elder guardians have 300 HP, same as the vanilla wither.\n- In combat, elder guardians will periodically debuff a random player with weakness, slowness, and/or blindness.\n- If no guardians are nearby, an elder guardian will periodically summon mini-guardians that disappear after a short time.\n- Below half HP, elder guardians will periodically turn invisible.\n- To compensate for all of this, the chance of dropping a Tide armor trim is increased to 100%.\n\nA video demonstrating this is shown below. It is slightly outdated, however, as instant damage on the periodic debuff has been removed. Coincidentally, it also demonstrates the new drowned features!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlpjHU2KDd8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Evokers</summary>\nEvokers are now mini-bosses that receive the following upgrades:\n \n- Evokers now have 150 HP, and while below half HP, they gain Regeneration 1.\n- Evokers also hold a totem of undying in their off-hand that must be popped before killing them. This doesn't change combat with them that much, but it does make sense thematically.\n- Whenever an evoker uses their fang attack, it will also follow up with two more waves of fangs in the same place.\n- To compensate for all of this, vexes now die immediately if there aren't any evokers nearby.\n\nFurthermore, two admin functions `upgradedmobs:evokers/raid_loot/enable` and `upgradedmobs:evokers/raid_loot/disable` are added. While enabled, evokers spawned during raids won't drop a totem anymore. Instead, they can drop golden apples, enchanted books, and lapis lazuli. This is disabled by default.\n</summary>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Piglin Brutes</summary>\nWhile their damage is untouched, piglin brutes now receive a few upgrades that make it harder to fight them than just knocking them back while you stand still:\n\n- Brutes have 75% knockback resistance by default.\n- Brutes will periodically dash at nearby players.\n- Brutes will *also* throw the closest player or wither skeleton high into the air. Watch out for lava!\n- Brutes have a small chance of spawning with random pieces of netherite armor, or with knockback on their axe.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Pillagers</summary>\nPillagers aren't holding back anymore.\n\n- Some pillagers will shoot weakness arrows or even firework rockets instead of regular arrows.\n- Some pillagers will also have Quick Charge II crossbows.\n- The above two upgrades are applied more often during raids.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Spiders</summary>\nEveryone *loves* spiders.\n\n- Spiders will periodically dash at nearby players.\n- They will also periodically trap the closest player in a cobweb. Remember to use a sword to break out!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Witches</summary>\nFor as rare as they are, witches are a little too easy.\n\n- Witches now have 60 HP.\n- Splash potions thrown by witches have a 25% chance of being lingering potions instead.\n- If a player is nearby, splash potions have a 10% chance of inflicting blindness.\n</details>\n\n### Configuration\nDon't like some of the features listed above? Want to adjust some of the probabilities? Want to give a modded mob some of these features? While there is no config file, you can open up the datapack ZIP to edit things yourself:\n\n- If you add a `#` symbol in front of a command in an `mcfunction` file, that line will be commented out and won't be ran.\n- You can integrate other mobs via the tag system. For example, if you have a mod that adds a new type of zombie, you can add it to the `upgradedmobs:zombies` entity tag. Note that you can also do this in an external datapack by adding the same tag file but with the `replace` key set to `false`.\n- This datapack includes a list of predicates for random probabilities. If you want to change a probability, you can replace the associated predicate with a different one, or make your own.\n- If you want to exclude individual mobs (e.g. custom bosses) from the features in this datapack to make sure nothing is overwritten, give them the `upgradedmobs.blacklist` tag.\n\nIf you want to uninstall this datapack, you can simply remove it from your world with no issues. However, buffs to HP, follow range and movement speed, and the like that were already made can't be reverted.\n\n### Credits\nI can't take credit for all of this. Below includes a few sources that I used while making this:\n- Some mechanics were taken from TheGayerest's old [Tougher Everything](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/tougher-everything/) and [Tougher Bosses](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/tougher-bosses-full-release/) datapacks, with permission given by the original author.\n- Some inspiration was taken from Kindred408's old [Smart Mobs](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/minecraft-but-mobs-are-smart/) datapack, although the actual implementation in this datapack is my original work.\n\n### Other Datapacks\nI recommend the following datapacks, in addition to this one:\n- [Vanilla Parity](https://modrinth.com/datapack/vanilla-parity) replaces the Wither with the Bedrock Wither.\n- The old datapacks [Blaze Tweaks](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blaze-tweaks/) and [Pillager Tweaks](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/pillager-tweaks/) by FlanDere allow blazes and pillagers to move backwards when a player approaches them, like crossbow piglins do (and forward, in the case of blazes).\n- My other packs! Check them out on my Modrinth page :)\n\nCompatibility-wise, this datapack should usually be fine. However, watch out for the following:\n- Datapacks like [Incendium](https://modrinth.com/mod/incendium) that have mobs or bosses with custom AI and features won't be overwritten (except for when this pack buffs a mobs HP and such), but this datapack's mechanics will also be applied, which may have unintended consequences. \n- For example, FlanDere also has a cool [Jumping Mobs](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/jumping-mobs-java-datapack-original-by-pheonixsc/) datapack, but dashes and jumps don't mix well (the mob can bounce really high accidentally).\n- Remember to give the `upgradedmobs.blacklist` tag to any mob that you don't want to be affected by this datapack.","published":"2023-07-16T21:30:03.271954Z","updated":"2024-05-19T18:59:10.115982Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":26804,"followers":161,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","mobs"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["Wcyiwkk8","WfWa7W5Z","byaVcmWw","B27Jdn1h","WYxx2C6V","RLvFCnae","rZ9JXMWZ","OLtpSLx7","ZkgXODwQ","Ho1Cb96h","34P8Wlp0","F16FOXz5","VO7FHcYq","FmMnnJfw","yfjLj5MK","cslakmgp","Qo6whabR","6kQgoxtY","OCMDeiMC","vthXuJMV","m4OVQv5L","KqFvKo2a"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iaFWBDP2/93f7090381019e87d20aee342027af07a57fe73b.webp"},"version":{"id":"KqFvKo2a","project_id":"iaFWBDP2","author_id":"gBflFHI3","featured":false,"name":"1.3.3

chests use static block models for improved performance.","body":"If your storage room contains a lot of chests, you have probably noticed how bad Minecraft is at rendering them. The more chests are placed, the lower your FPS go.\n\nFastChest helps by removing their dynamic models (aka BlockEntityRenderer) and making them render as static chunk geometry, like most normal blocks. (This means they will lose their lid opening animation! Check out [Enhanced Block Entities](https://modrinth.com/mod/ebe) if you care about that.)\n\nDepending on how many chests you have around, you'll see varying effectiveness. In large storage rooms this mod can easily double your FPS, but keep in mind that chests aren't the only thing responsible for bad performance.\n\nFastChest works with Sodium and Optifine and should be compatible with all other mods and resource packs that leave chests alone. For example, the *Vanilla Tweaks Proper Break Particles* resource pack doesn't. It overwrites the chest blockstate definitions and is not compatible out of the box. You can however delete `chest.json`, `ender_chest.json` and `trapped_chest.json` from the `/assets/minecraft/blockstates` directory of your resource pack to make it work with the mod.\n\nA classic (full-block) chest resource pack can be downloaded from [here](https://up.domi.re/pa1f7rxa).\n","published":"2023-09-23T23:08:38.006171Z","updated":"2023-11-06T11:44:33.258213Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":59366,"followers":88,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["Dk9lpuiC","nyEDcRrB","hNZkXlPh","y0MNfkeB","DjQllHib","1UK7dyZ1","MQXv1FCf","jm8zP5GA","DY9aRIvz","jURzorVi","2pqk3SqY","9TMPN7m0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WNcgffMw/24755b2f991530a2c511f9eb8c93a39da8e3073d.png"},"version":{"id":"9TMPN7m0","project_id":"WNcgffMw","author_id":"Ld1GCkRF","featured":false,"name":"FastChest 1.5+1.20.2","version_number":"1.5+1.20.2","changelog":"Prevent chest client ticks  \nUpdate config screen for 1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-06T11:44:33.873941Z","downloads":13672,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"29920fb6786f39a5859244d29daeb7e5f4ec3972","sha512":"53cd149ae9e832b75b3f8d965c71696b76b30e334e2cc7965eadfa36a56e713dddfc1c13b67129301da7d864d88b145e6015f95b8e8f784cdd0c1a6fd66fec49"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WNcgffMw/versions/9TMPN7m0/fast-chest-1.5%2B1.20.2.jar","filename":"fast-chest-1.5+1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":24770,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"OOMBoK47","user":{"id":"Ld1GCkRF","username":"Domi","name":"Domi","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1492543?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-27T16:58:23.621460Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fast-chest-1.5+1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\wakes-0.2.4.jar":{"sha512":"1eef5d453b85962331cf8cb50f493ac8d43a0678aeffe07f478ef19d03cc8e21d23b073dbe34aed6ec9aa1a609bb38530090d2ac2d131a5741a67bc6fc116217","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"dlNu0RQY","slug":"wakes","project_type":"mod","team":"hrqRTB6A","title":"Wakes","description":"Adds splashes and wakes while traveling on water","body":"[![Modrinth Downloads](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/wakes?logo=modrinth&color=00AF5C)](https://modrinth.com/mod/wakes) [![CurseForge Downloads](https://img.shields.io/curseforge/dt/884267?logo=curseforge&color=ff784d)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wakes)\n\n## DISCLAIMER\nMy time developing the mod will be quite limited up until June 2024.

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-04-29T16:00:45.150007Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":10290455,"followers":13182,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.8","version_number":"mc1.20.4-0.5.8","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Fabric API 0.95.3+ when using High Contrast or Programmer Art resource packs.\n- Improved support for keyboard accessibility features in parts of the video settings screen.

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Designed for better user experience and API.\n\nJade can be installed only on the client side. But many features require Jade on the server side. (item storage, horse stats, bees in beehive...)\n\n**For mod integration, try Jade Addons: [Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-forge)  [Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-fabric)**\n\n### Keys (default):\n\n - Keypad 0: Open configuration screen\n - Keypad 1: Toggle overlay\n - Keypad 2: Toggle liquid display\n - Keypad 3:

Occasional sudden brightness changes are a side-effect of the way it works and cannot be completely removed without hurting performance or removing sharp shadows from light sources. To do the latter, disable `Per-Pixel Lighting` in the `Rethinking Voxels Settings`. \n\nThis shader is developed on Iris, using an AMD graphics card on linux, and it is also tested on an NVidia graphics card on linux. While it usually works on other platforms, bugs that appear only there are not caught by my testing and hence they take longer to fix. To use this shader pack, the Iris shader loader is required. Beta 18d and older versions also work on OptiFine.\n\n### Contact\n\nIf you need support, please join the [shaderLabs discord server](https://discord.gg/8wT5KxF4TZ), where this shader has a channel (#rethinking-voxels-gri573).\n\n### Partnership\n\nI have entered a partnership with Ember, a Minecraft server hosting provider. This is because Ember hosts the complementary SMP server and has provided a better hosting experience / customer support than the previous hosting service, and because they reached out asking about it. If you need to host a Minecraft server and wish to support Rethinking Voxels' development at the same time, do check them out! Using the promotional code `RETHINKING` in a first-time purchase will redirect 50% of the first month's fee to me as well as give you a 10% discount.\n\n[![banner with text: Ember host - use code RETHINKING for 10% off](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/394d7c1de5f4581320d26006966f7e09984c10ce.png)](https://billing.ember.host/aff.php?aff=13)\n\n### Media\n\nVideo by youtube user iambeen that showcases rethinking voxels beta 18d (with custom settings), compared to the original reimagined:\n<iframe width=\"1920\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xrnRubNmz5U\" title=\"An Incredible Edit Of One Of The Best Minecraft Shaders\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","published":"2023-01-08T08:51:26.064993Z","updated":"2024-03-31T21:43:36.421979Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1067602,"followers":2476,"categories":["colored-lighting","shadows"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","fantasy","foliage","high","medium","pbr","reflections","screenshot"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"],"versions":["JJYZpa9f","2R38mihv","bzxGCRvk","mW86PJDv","AGmTd5nw","2K4NatZc","Kvz3zyPE","9VdB64Tg","CTSiDh5A","zJ98z3TB","uwtVXtKt","9XRHd6iA","n6JDuo3v","jMCUHmuD","IQJj9pCB","5NlLe3RT","jRGaYHpC","eRdjYNno","kVgJJYab","KgJHr8Dp","XoCWYDjr","14mGpe0b","b0FIbZO5","l5ivuwMY","sj3rknwd","1LqpOU4L","YZmnZG0z","HQ07gLxO","nHx51bUG","3e7utNwI","1vaiswPE","H05Uhtt3","AWtumMpy","kT5rXgon","4QxN9Se8","9sZPgPWg","kxINFUyA","i5OG3ddh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kmwfVOoi/e5cbf3b6f078da56b87e64a4605e741382b2ec17.png"},"version":{"id":"i5OG3ddh","project_id":"kmwfVOoi","author_id":"q431BPyo","featured":false,"name":"r0.1-beta3-fix1","version_number":"r0.1-beta3","changelog":"- Change raytracing algorithm from voxel RT to SDF raymarching\n  - this allows raytracing against dynamic shapes such as custom models or entities\n- add single-sample soft shadow approximation\n- remove denoising and accumulation as they are no longer needed\n- remove option to disable \"trace to all lights\"\n- add maximum light trace count setting\n- add options to disable entities, the player and foliage in raytracing\n- remove end game of life\n- add world-space reflections","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-31T21:43:37.223074Z","downloads":115463,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d061ec2d424bd7129fbf1ed650b10aa4678a2526","sha512":"6dc310331ff5d1a0f5410fb8a66ecfc56c455d86bc6df03e464e04c83171706aafc802845ae94e07b950c2739415e8a23bc81ba2847bbbd30c3d2d555881e7f1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kmwfVOoi/versions/i5OG3ddh/rethinking-voxels_r0.1-beta3-fix1.zip","filename":"rethinking-voxels_r0.1-beta3-fix1.zip","primary":true,"size":493088,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["iris"]},"members":[{"team_id":"mJ2GH0BM","user":{"id":"q431BPyo","username":"gri573","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66473137?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-15T07:57:44.906660Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"rethinking-voxels_r0.1-beta3-fix1.zip"},"mods\\Geophilic-v2.3.0-1.20.3+.jar":{"sha512":"b1717bfd151cd8c2a1fe31877067213f1ed9966723e9e58c6de87a7b396ab6abe782b1fd52171a8d6acd0ff24d0b2236fc47ce6f891c830748aaeaee97c4d391","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"hl5OLM95","slug":"geophilic","project_type":"mod","team":"VnZb9yVa","title":"Geophilic","description":"A subtle overhaul of vanilla Overworld biomes","body":"![](https://i.imgur.com/yJbL99N.png)  \n\n### 🌲 About\n**Geophilic** is a data pack that improves vanilla Overworld biomes in a subtle and simple way! The main inspiration comes from scrapped illustrations for what was *supposed* to be the *Wild Update* - this is essentially meant to be a collection of light improvements to vanilla biomes without any new blocks, items, or even new biomes.  \n\nMain changes are made to the rarity and density of certain biome features, such as grass, fern, or flowers. New features are added too - rocks, fallen trees, moss, tree stumps, bushes, and sometimes new types of trees. Most trees are however left almost fully vanilla, with the only change being how tall naturally occurring trees generate, so you don't bump your head so often!  \n\nBasically, this isn't meant to be an epic terrain overhaul, but rather a simplistic and nice way to update the feel of vanilla biomes to the new standard, without making them feel too out of place.  \n\n### 📦 Content\n**1.0.0:** Taiga, Birch Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest, Desert, Flower Forest, Forest, Swamp, Windswept Forest and Windswept Hills  \n**1.1.0:** All above plus Dark Forest, Badlands, Savanna and Savanna Plateau  \n**1.2.0:** All above plus Plains  \n**2.0.0:** Badlands, Birch Forest, Dark Forest, Deep Ocean, Desert, Eroded Badlands, Flower Forest, Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest, Old Growth Pine Taiga, Old Growth Spruce Taiga, Plains, Savanna, Savanna Plateau, Snowy Plains, Snowy Slopes, Stony Shore, Sunflower Plains, Swamp, Taiga, Windswept Forest, Windswept Savanna, Wooded Badlands  \n\nSee the gallery for pictures!\n\n### 📝 Note\nThis mod **only affects vanilla biome files and adds configured and placed features**, which is important because it means it is compatible with other mods and data packs that change the way your terrain generates.

Well, that's not a coincidence anymore! Each elder guardian will drop a <strong>Trident Fragment</strong>; combine those with a few prismarine shards, and there's your brand new trident!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But what do you do when your trident is about to run out of durability? Simple: <strong>Repair It With Some Prismarine Shards</strong> using an anvil! Why do you even ask, that's obvious, isn't it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Let's talk about the loyalty enchantment: So your trident comes back to you, nice. But where does it go? Somewhere in your inventory to dig up again? And when you throw it into the void in the End, it's just gone. And what about all the fancy loot from the mobs you've slain, you need to go over there to collect it. Really? Well, all fixed: Tridents always return to the slot they are thrown from (even without loyalty), when thrown into the void they return, and any loot dropped by mobs will come flying at you together with the trident itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Besides that, <strong>Impaling Works As It Does On Bedrock Edition</strong>: any mob in contact with water or rain will receive increased damage. This is especially great, since tridents now finally work against those annoying drowneds infesting your beautiful oceans.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/965/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/966/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tridents with loyalty collect all drops for you</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Your trident is damaged?

In details:\n* Real-time preview and reload TrueType/OpenType fonts\n* A better font fallback implementation\n* Anti-aliasing text and FreeType font hinting\n* Use improved SDF text rendering in 2D/3D (also use batch rendering)\n* Compute exact font size in device space for native glyph rendering\n* Use Google Noto Color Emoji and support all the Unicode 15.1 Emoji (September 12, 2023)\n* Configurable bidirectional text heuristic algorithm\n* Configurable text shadow and raw font size\n* Unicode line breaking and CSS line-break & word-break\n* Fast, exact and asynchronous Unicode text layout computation\n* Faster and more memory efficient rectangle packing algorithm for glyphs\n* Use real grayscale texture (1 byte-per-pixel, whereas Minecraft is 4 bpp)\n* Compatible with OptiFine, Sodium (Rubidium), Iris (Oculus) and many mods\n* Compatible with Minecraft's JSON font definition (bitmap fonts, TTF fonts)\n\nAdditionally, this Mod provides many utilities which improve game performance and gaming experience. Currently, we have:\n* Changing screen background color\n* Gaussian blur to screen backdrop image\n* Fade-in animation to screen background\n* More window modes: Fullscreen (borderless), Maximized (borderless)\n* Framerate limit and master volume fading on window inactive (out of focus) and minimized\n* Pausing single-player game when Inventory is open\n* Changing GUI scale option to Slider and providing hint text\n* Playing a \"Ding\" sound when Minecraft loads and reaches the Main Menu\n* Enabling smooth scrolling in Vanilla's Selection List and Forge's Scroll Panel\n* Pressing \"C\" to Zoom that is the same as OptiFine\n* Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) and Unicode grapheme/word iterator for all text fields\n* Playing local music, allowing to seek and view spectrum\n* Support Discord/Slack/GitHub/IamCal/JoyPixels emoji shortcodes in Chatting\n* A fancy tooltip style\n  + Choose rounded border or normal border (with shadow effect)\n  + Add title break and control title line spacing\n  + Auto line wrapping and auto vertical scrolling when out of screen\n  + Center the title line, support RTL layout direction\n  + Exactly position the tooltip to pixel grid (smooth movement)\n  + Change background color and border color (with gradient and animation)\n \n\n### Core Features:\n\n* 2D Graphics Library of Multiple Graphics APIs\n* Intermediate Representation and ASTs of Shading Languages\n* Symbolic distance function and vector graphics rendering\n* Image post-processing effects\n* Fast matrix and vector calculation\n* Image format conversion\n* Animation and transition framework\n* Event loop and multi-threading framework\n* Text shaping and complex text layout engine\n* MVVM and lifecycle handling\n* Automatic RTL (right-to-left) UI layout\n* Markdown (CommonMark) rendering support\n \n\n### Modern Text Engine for Minecraft:\n\n* Support color Emoji, use Google Noto Color Emoji 15.1, based on Unicode 15.1 Emoji list;\n* Support Emoji shortcodes in chat, for example :rofl: to rolling on the floor laughing, support Discord and Slack shortcodes;\n* You can use TTF or OTF fonts, configure the font base size, set the baseline shift, and set whether to drop text shadow;\n* Scalable vector graphics, automatic switching resolution level (up to 96px), native (non-synthetic) Bold and Italic rendering;\n* Supports distance field text rendering in 3D world, but sharpens font atlas in 2D GUI; This enhances a former feature:\n  *Render all characters smoothly on any scale (like when you're away from a sign, or a very small text in GUI)\n* Support multilayer text, layout multiple paragraphs together, streaming layout algorithm, and introduce fast layout cache;\n* Support fast digit replacement, high-precision layout and alignment, and smoothly draw fast changing digits (fixed width);\n* Support mip-mapping, anti-aliasing, linear sampling and supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA);\n* Better and more efficient layout of BiDi text paragraphs (e.g. Arabic, Yiddish); Use sharpen font atlases;\n* Configurable BiDi text heuristic algorithm to control text direction more accurately; Support to fix invalid surrogate pairs;\n* Use HarfBuzz text shaping, support combining characters rendering, like Thai, Devanagari, Bengali and Tamil;\n* Support grapheme cluster break, support Unicode line breaking algorithm;\n* Support context-aware and locale-based word break and line break;\n* Support pixelated font rendering, support fixed resolution level, support pixel alignment;\n* Support bitmap replacement, rendering smoothly for fast changing numbers, support emoji rendering;\n* Optimize the layout algorithm, increase your FPS by about 10% when drawing texts in GUI\n* Use grayscale pixels to store texture, reduce GPU memory usage\n* Reduce unnecessary RAM usage and greatly reduce object creation\n\n### Customize Fonts\nPress Ctrl+K or ⌘+K (by default) to open Action Center, go to Preferences, swipe the screen to the second page, and you will see Font settings.\n* Preferred font family is your most wanted one. It can be either an OS font or a TrueType/OpenType font (collection) file.\n* Fallback font families are used when the preferred font family is unavailable.\n\nModern Text Engine:  \nModern UI follows Minecraft's JSON font definition, only glyph provider type 'legacy_unicode' and 'unihex' are ignored. Modern UI font families mentioned above will serve as fallback font families for Minecraft fonts. Default Font Behavior (in Preferences > Text Layout) gives you an option to remove some glyph providers from the Minecraft default font (minecraft:default). To avoid using vanilla ASCII fonts, just set it to Keep Other. Note this option is only valid if you have not turned on Force Unicode Font. If you want to use vanilla Unicode font, just download the OTF version of [GNU Unifont](https://unifoundry.com/unifont/).\n\n### Additional Features for Minecraft:\n\n* Support setting window mode, such as fullscreen borderless, windowed borderless;\n* GUI screen background fade-in animation and 2-pass gaussian convolution blur effect, configurable background gradient color;\n* Smooth rounded tooltip style, support RTL layout, configurable background and border color;\n* Play a \"ding\" sound effect when the game is loaded;\n* Support pausing the game when your inventory is opened;\n* New GUI scale algorithm and slider GUI scale widget (not limited to even numbers, compatible with OptiFine);\n* Add smooth scrolling for vanilla and forge scrolling panels;\n* Async network handler; Server auto-shutdown;\n* All features are configurable in configs or Action Center screen (default shortkey Ctrl+K)\n\n### Modern UI for Fabric removed some features (compared to the Forge version):\n* OptiFine-like zoom, hide crosshairs in GUI\n* Dump more debugging information, crash report extension\n \n### Comparison with Caxton text rendering techniques\n[Caxton](https://modrinth.com/mod/caxton) mod is known for its MSDF text rendering, you can choose between Caxton and Modern Text Engine.   \n\nSimilarities:\n* Both use HarfBuzz text shaping\n* Both support Unicode text processing\n* Both support Unicode line breaking and grapheme cluster break\n* Both compatible with Iris in raster rendering mode\n* Both have an efficient rectangle packing algorithm, further better than Mojang's\n\nDifferences:\n* Caxton uses a newer HarfBuzz whereas we use a older one (bundled with JDK 17, it's updated in JDK 21)\n* Caxton uses multi-channel SDF and renders sharper scaling-up texts, whereas we render over-rounded\n* We are compatible with OptiFine, whereas Caxton isn't\n* We support color emoji, whereas Caxton doesn't\n* We support FreeType font hinting whereas Caxton never support it, font hinting helps on low-res monitor\n* We support perfect sampling of native glyph image in screen-space, this is ideal for 2D rendering\n* We support single-channel SDF text rendering without additional GPU resources, we always use 1bpp textures\n* We have smart SDF sampling method for scaling-down texts, whereas Caxton hasn't\n* No need to wait for MSDF texture generation, you can switch fonts in-game with just one click\n* We support various text direction heuristics and line break strategies\n* We don't use additional native libraries, so Modern UI works on macOS\n* We have a slightly higher layout performance than Caxton, and use less RAM\n\n### Mod Integration & Compatibility:\n\n#### Compatible (you should pay attention to):\n\nOptiFine, Sodium, Iris, Create, AoA3  \nIf Shaders are active, *Use Modern Text Shaders in 3D* is auto disabled, it will cause the outline of glowing text to become invisible.\n\n#### Mods with similar functions are replaced:\n\n* Blur (ver 1.15 ~ 1.20; reason: full functional coverage, better optimization)\n  + Blur mod claims to use Gaussian blur, but I found it actually uses 2-pass box blur. Whereas Modern UI gives you the true 1-pass Gaussian Blur, which is better than Blur mod.\n* Controlling (ver 1.15; reason: another way of implementation)\n* TipTheScales (ver 1.15 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Inventory Pause (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Emojiful (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: we support color emoji rendering since 3.5.0; additionally, Emojiful has really bad code and breaks your game everywhere; you may experience game freezing, high VRAM usage, rendering glitches, and many performance & mod compatibility issues)\n* Borderless Window (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Ding (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* SmoothScrollingEverywhere (ver 1.18 ~ 1.19; reason: another way of implementation)\n* FPS Reducer (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n\n\n#### Conflict and Solution:\n\n* Emojiful (ver 1.16 ~ 1.20; it's not recommended to use Emojiful; if you must use it,  disable Modern UI text engine, via config screen or bootstrap properties)\n* Legendary Tooltips (ver 1.16 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI tooltip, via config screen)\n* FeyTweaks (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable TextRendererMixin in FeyTweaks' mixin config)\n* SmoothScrollingEverywhere (ver 1.18 ~ 1.19; solution: disable Modern UI smooth scrolling, via config screen)\n* Caxton (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI text engine, via config screen or bootstrap properties)\n* ImmediatelyFast (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable ImmediatelyFast's hud_batching, font_atlas_resizing and fast_text_lookup; otherwise, you may experience random game crashes)\n* Untranslated Items (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI text component cache, via config screen)\n\n#### Supported MC versions:\n* Actively maintained: 1.20.4, 1.20.1, 1.19.4, 1.19.2\n* About to be dropped: 1.20.2, 1.20, 1.18.2, 1.18.1\n* No longer supported: 1.18, 1.17.1, 1.16.5, 1.16.4, 1.16.3, 1.16.2, 1.16.1, 1.15.2, 1.14.4\n\nAll descriptions on this page are for Minecraft 1.19.4 and above. Some features may be missing in older versions.\n\n#### PC Requirements (same as Minecraft Vanilla)\nSome people are unwilling to use Modern UI because they believe that Modern UI has a high PC requirements. In fact, as long as you can play Minecraft Vanilla, you can definitely play Modern UI. Unless you forget to update your GPU driver.\n* OS: Windows 8.1+, Linux with X11 or Wayland, macOS\n* Architecture: x64 or arm64\n* GPU: GeForce 210 or better\n* GPU Driver: OpenGL 3.3+ or Vulkan 1.1+, higher is better\n* Java: Java 17+, higher is better\n\n\n### FAQ:\n\n##### Q: What is the difference between Default Font Behavior and Force Unicode Font?\nA: Firstly, Modern UI always redirects Unicode font to Modern UI default typeface. Default Font Behavior is KEEP ALL in 1.19+, then Minecraft default font is used for ASCII characters. KEEP OTHER means that Minecraft default font is no longer used, but additional fonts, for example, in some minigame maps, are still available. This is the difference from Force Unicode Font (IGNORE ALL).\n\n##### Q: Does Modern UI have a high overhead? Will Modern UI lower application performance?\nA: No, Modern UI does not have a significant impact on CPU, GPU, RAM, and VRAM usage. This is because Modern UI itself has good optimization, but at the same time, Modern UI provides a bunch of new features and effects. Modern UI framework is known to be more efficient than Chromium-based applications.\nFor low-end PCs, screen blur effect may be a performance killer, because Minecraft Vanilla does not allow mipmap generation on render targets. Even so, the blur effect provided by Modern UI is much faster than a mod called 'Blur'.\n\n##### Q: How to disable all changes to vanilla, I don't want these features.\nA: Only GUI scale algorithm and some low-level code are non-configurable, any other features can be disabled in Action Center screen (shortkey Ctrl+K by default), or config files (gameDir/config/ModernUI/), because Modern UI is essentially a framework.\n\n##### Q: Is this mod a client-only mod? Do I need to install it on the server?\nA: Since MC 1.19.2, there is no reason to install this mod on the server anymore. All server features are deprecated and implemented to Forge API and Fabric API.\n\n##### Q: How to get start to develop my mod based on Modern UI?\nA: This project is still in early stages, the specification is still being written. You can view the [JavaDoc](https://blocamlimb.github.io/ModernUI/javadoc/). Examples include Modern UI itself (Action Center) and Flux Networks.

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: Why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features).\n</details>\n\n----------\n\n![ToS](https://imgur.com/zqDp5zR.png)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Terms of Use:</summary>  \n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n**Fresh Animations: Terms & Conditions**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n- By using this resource pack, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions\n- FreshLX is the creator and copyright owner of this resource pack\n- These terms are subject to change at any time\n- These terms only apply if you intend to use the resource pack in your own content you want to share publicly\n- The terms listed on the official project CurseForge, Modrinth, and Planet Minecraft pages, supersede any license, readme or terms/conditions information provided anywhere else, including in the resource pack files\n- Not all the assets/elements of this resource pack are subject to these terms.

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-04-29T20:44:11.845709Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6232390,"followers":9271,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"nMhjKWVE","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium

good stuff, and tweaks that makes the structures even better. Chests now will have more variated loot, and not the same expected loot over and over.\n♦ All small ruins now will generate more frequently, makes the ocean more alive and less boring to explore.\n♦ Added a little small potencial to drowned farms in the underwater city structure, some normal vanilla drowned will spawn around the city.\n♦ Speaking of underwater cities, improved the way of how these generate, making them a little bit more deep that before, this new generation might be look similar to how we see ancient cities.\n♦ Added some death corals around the city.\n♦ New arrow effect.\n♦ Improved drowneds AI (only drowneds that are part of the city), now they will know when exactly atack, and not every single one of them will track you in the same time, this change makes

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-05-16T18:29:48.419704Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3437395,"followers":3489,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"48hFxWw7","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.3","version_number":"3.4.3","changelog":"Changes:\n\n-

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3025039,"followers":3574,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

To open the config screen you'll need to install [Mod Menu](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modmenu).\n\n## Limitations\nSince this mod is completely clientside item scrolling might be a bit laggy on hard-working servers.\n\n\nThis mod will not work in *Applied Energistics 2* screens and inventories. AE2 handles inventory screens even more strangely than Mojang handles creative inventories, so don't expect any fixes from my side!\n\nTo make you aware of this MW declares a conflict with AE2 which will show up in the log. This incompatibility only applies to certain mods and all other inventories will work fine.\n\n## Before Version 1.3.4\nThere are bugs in Tweed (library used by Mouse Wheelie) and Artifice (library of Extra Pieces) which make these mods incompatible when bundled within other mods.\n\nTo make Mouse Wheelie work with Extra Pieces please install the latest version of Tweed alongside!\n\nWith version 1.3.4 this bug has been fixed in Tweed and my other library mods - so no more incompatibilities from my side. Currently this bug still persists in Artifice so other mods might still be incompatible with Extra Pieces and all derivatives of Artifice.\n","published":"2020-12-22T00:25:18.334979Z","updated":"2023-12-15T14:45:32.209212Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":455146,"followers":1186,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w13a","21w14a","21w15a","21w16a","21w17a","21w18a","21w19a","1.17-pre1","1.17-pre2","1.17-pre3","1.17-pre4","1.17-pre5","1.17-rc1","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1-pre2","1.17.1-pre3","1.17.1-rc1","1.17.1-rc2","1.17.1","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre2","1.18-pre3","1.18-pre4","1.18-pre5","1.18-rc1","1.18-rc2","1.18-rc3","1.18","1.18.1","22w06a","1.18.2","22w16a","22w17a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19-pre5","1.19-rc1","1.19-rc2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["h719hnXo","24XWVv4H","mJVsiau8","yDQNiG1v","8sEmZ1nD","rnZXbVTB","ByYgvJhU","TZ0z6i7D","Ag98NrKK","PggOD3er","Rd0u7syf","6wJJQ33X","Amzyl6VC","HLoh2XXB","E8qJEpfg","7ddYbYW3","iQxwgiAF","TDmKKgak","fzNZlwOq","qcqrslIb","lKmF2uif","cee0obg3","4wlSrHMh","XIM4RiiZ","SycN5fV0","bjmjyen4","2u7IS1Lw","7FltZwOv","8xFCTh5W","zftsBLjV","hQm4udmf","CoYvVu0u","gL7KvZHU","mlAMqe16","RlzDkw4F","DoQwGDO3","rpbGK5iK","iTzFhLN4","pQNfi4Bx","ZQug1Aeg","itUXGzbC","Lf04bCin","SixCZfVc","cCV9Xcrd","IzMqpyhD","WMg1QsIk","FzmzRaLi","fzZPBH5c","5CUmFU4E","3ngJL09J","b9WaTx7Z","Huy754AQ","FktpYSQi","3ytj4zL0","lwpAqVaH","yvwXSQdv","Rr1DcHMq","3J1aNVLJ","23Nw5zzU","iiu83Y3c","UeiAKbpX","gFA95EIa","zY7Cf3LW","cM3ObaFu","fHlm0rzK","agVRPZ4D","MPCf9ut6","PEKBd3El","PkISnwUh","GfgvMtyQ","xwp8g9CO","FOq96T8x","xTx0O62x","lXkJSYAH","yQusLI7s","fNtdHcP5","6Y1z49b4","khSmZgLT","TEtrxmrp","wUp62kni","wBqPB5xY","tXfvYvI1","2ebv7N77","VinQJO3v","ymIYCJPX","b1B6X2Ts","NTpvjLr2","a4SvIbAl","Soe84zhH","dryZj18F","DQZQWgOz","nJNMgakE","nmB6cDYk","7hY6TItH","KY8qViXG","P6lILGgm","chRnLbfn","GdHlLNRp","va0UPMPO","jHVCUNXq","J0haBi6t","Zl5ysFVm","mnbVSXOO","5HmD82tm","idJfKEnz","bCGRhsZx","KMjUmnju","Ja2BYc1Y","o6RxDq9H","oaIp47rP","OhnrKojw","fLRP12Mt","iIdZaHt3","ZvHQfeTB","xQflaC4T","gjck3ULm","SqayzTTv","HO17Gk1z","rIYypwDC","lcCY0KZL","rvkjp7nF","93JSZCN4","dgBoPrse","4iex10ex","5aMlBb4H","e0rd3G30","3K7SCKOR","Mm0H8wn7","BEsP37OJ","8n4MvQ1n","CkjvPWpv","sgkCkgSO","Gud3HLU2","VoRXECAU","lgzMuZBH","FbQkpg7G","EPlvximc","6uHsa6Rn","f24IuTiJ","q2BSIY4P","8oect3E2","HDUIbH1G","ayAWRAes","JGZJ4UqD","tBQLIhI1","PQGEoKza","1xCyaLWg","MC48NEHw","5mYFyLcg","2VMUOKtw","vv9WzK01","ugx6shZH","R0tsn51l","uaxAu6IZ","4hjGaj6D","c6Ht2mCa","yb0UJjSM","MpGOHks3","Y0sGEyyU","fWlmQNBf","3ni9nRcB","WzN3aIKG","vpoRSwN4","GlENOQej","5q5ojaBJ","WOL5XBup","bTHE5J3n","o7VxXDbj","UygfI1MO","HPzsUVnT","faPpjxKD","uQqxNGqs","hUZXtd1H","pgVpuqvW","C3dGBp1r","vymcxgLT","T7Ogh3Ft","Nbpfn58U","EJvmB978","jyqMTpO1","jNgyObL0","wZQXaled","iTSdJaug","371iEBPS","tTMaU713","r1RocWRi","8RLuRzch","QmT8RpnQ","eN3F8JKA","Xyl3zo4h","ZipUueYk","QXkLg21K","cu12faXh","m0dAzH9I","LeOE3qju","I5ILhd6J","auT5QGkW","f0VEYjAS","KdK5dXWp","Ow7EojXn","ZfHqIlXv","e8Y4GnH0","SSkZxx08","H7OsQ8Jt","iF7T9odz","5TxOjQHP","uMGgnGSW","4aQoMc29","tcruvzMQ","XvWmUhot","Vd71xYQG","aRVszPQB","aONy2c3p","TCt49JkS","BUydj5yt","KNLEqpmH","yTSkWqiJ","QNBiceN7","1uDKNRQF","ZDH1ONdq","IjbA4WTe","kgCmdbQm","xWpY6VCr","eGC7FVo7","5R7l84zv","kvQiy5Oa","W6lK0S30","wPtDzPBH","jE5B3lub","Hg3JOa79","EzeYeJRf","73ivfwq5"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/u5Ic2U1u/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"73ivfwq5","project_id":"u5Ic2U1u","author_id":"JJJqUOvE","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.3+]

various treasure items that can be found through exploration","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochotonida/artifacts/1.18/src/main/resources/logo.png)\n\nSome older versions of this mod can be found on curseforge: [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts) /  [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts-fabric)\n\nArtifacts is a mod which aims to make exploration more rewarding by adding various powerful items that cannot be crafted.\n\nThe items added by this mod can be found in chests in vanilla structures, through archaeology, or can very rarely be found worn by entities. All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items and their descriptions can be found in the images tab. Sn up-to-date list of where each item can be found is available on the wiki on GitHub.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack. Information about the data formats used can be found on the [Trinkets wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Trinkets-Data-Formats).\n\n#### _Which mod are you using to put artifacts on armor stands?_\n\n[Curious Armor Stands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curious-armor-stands \"\").\n\n#### _Can I still find artifacts if I add this mod to a world that has already been generated?_\n\nCampsites and mimics will only spawn in chunks that were generated after you downloaded the mod. You will still be able to find artifacts in unopened chests in existing chunks.\n\n#### [Forge] _Whey I try to open the Curios menu to equip my artifacts, nothing happens._\n\nSome server plugins can cause this (https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/issues/131). If you're using plugins, verify that this issue also happens in a Forge-only environment before asking for help.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/298798089068609537/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/87pXJadaRr)","published":"2022-06-14T16:56:58.872057Z","updated":"2024-05-05T13:10:17.901667Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":346336,"followers":466,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["vtfSrjwt","enKgSs94","mPPkxtPE","tr5a9mT8","e4CTWqPl","fSw9kqQh","V8ExzIs5","NyF72ZGD","o0rov6DO","qXHbzxWN","3uzmjVVv","qrgK6WbC","qYmael6x","aR9WUkuw","jNhlay28","l9VPEvbV","V30gGFiR","mqynvjMF","M29wAfi3","lEZPMdyg","NZW4ytS1","Mx3Od65u","v3E2bsYR","1DMHqctP","bJzHzT51","6DXOR2pO","b349kUSi","Czb4tu7o","bfIQoQHe","r3FHm0nE","bbR3MLn5","9LAXM8mY","DcVGTlgT","KmlubFpZ","IvSt1a0t","TdKHoxTe","IfIR5Ism","QocOGlCW","2GfgtAam","4dYkst1S","sHrGzycI","PebrQais","zdWM9d47","iyqyMkD3","9Kojdc30","DDQl0gcS","xSYcBxz1","e7pOMiUY","X7e1GWpM","edfEyLZL","yD2sUuih","EH6eSF3G","ssCNWbE6","Uetdhalv","lswKVrnX","dPhbqtM6","Odf79yb4","xGYyX1il","EAwGZiN8","9t7hc6bZ","AoKWNF4Z","LIJxLjYS","Ajy5hbi6","ybE3XjDX","WvvsDJxJ","gbxaQJBL","X75XmT50","8mZ5UnPo"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/P0Mu4wcQ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"X75XmT50","project_id":"P0Mu4wcQ","author_id":"Q50e8wKr","featured":false,"name":"Artifacts

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-02-06T00:32:19.293889Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4598035,"followers":5892,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Aouse6P7","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.30 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.8/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog":"- Also allow 1.20.1 (fixes #277) (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-06T00:32:27.223998Z","downloads":1404265,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b24233f29c0ce4802c61ea8998e01e6e4580ae60","sha512":"3b9c9beef42f72bc75094595c92038c38e36fcde75890c73ced01aed4fb2a8a85cddb8edd2aa91ea6ed2dd41f8afedaa3dbca8f70c716197a7f2ee5b26060562"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/Aouse6P7/indium-1.0.30%2Bmc1.20.4.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":104805,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\FishTank-1.0.2-1.20.4-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"950854355ea9a82393f1a37612872e28f8e4a9560e1e5e23701dc92f18bbfa698492f9dcd4458b41386ba5ae19cba2293c6d3e5a158ae0be9d6105bd2a57f6c4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"3M3QnxVe","slug":"fish-tanks","project_type":"mod","team":"sPEM1on7","title":"Fish Tanks","description":"Adds fish tanks for your favorite aquatic friends!","body":"![Logo](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/903034361329360989/1180387801989128212/image.png?ex=66391a8e&is=6637c90e&hm=7db3a89e42864eb6ed7e248fb78982aea502162a86a3127cf8676d1e923fec95&=&quality=lossless)\nBuild fish tanks in all sorts of fun shapes for your fish, or have a small tank just for decoration. \n\n \n\nTanks are multi-blocks meaning if you put 2 side by side, they will merge into a two block long tank.

Also, there is the Tinted Fish Tank, but who would want their fishies to be in eternal darkness?\n\n![Small Fish Tank](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891173183854608465/938618168107237386/small.png)\n![Large Fish Tank](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/891173183854608465/938618167767466034/big.png)","published":"2023-11-28T23:48:13.698026Z","updated":"2023-12-08T04:56:34.681130Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":9707,"followers":35,"categories":["decoration","mobs"],"additional_categories":["storage","utility"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["arIANfkF","TyvIjPHN","r2NKQoli","NYeMZtbK","YzoyXi11","gLqVlQNk","EHK2Tble","1grgydku","OqKAmGAi","MfxJBb3l","XXC3YeS8","Wedu0cgt","xnLZ8jRq","p9Jd2eXH","jJDVgPn4","CQnw4mne","nt8MVefR","2mvDDEOy","n8q13Dh8","2sgoOcbR","G0wM8Q7E","fVXkQwHI","dNJ7d3pY","euBKYLPo","eJKH2TXL","FVcYzXCD","4BbD2ZFb","JZte1UnL","5Ql1StaA","X9bSsrao"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3M3QnxVe/561147fe9f039a7862624a9e9389bfd7f76b5e7a.png"},"version":{"id":"X9bSsrao","project_id":"3M3QnxVe","author_id":"rAaEWsp8","featured":false,"name":"Fish Tanks 1.0.2 (Fabric 1.20.4)","version_number":"1.0.2-fabric-1.20.4","changelog":"- Updated to 1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-08T04:56:35.360691Z","downloads":759,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"950854355ea9a82393f1a37612872e28f8e4a9560e1e5e23701dc92f18bbfa698492f9dcd4458b41386ba5ae19cba2293c6d3e5a158ae0be9d6105bd2a57f6c4","sha1":"855a7f7333b5445958618a615ffa8a5190974840"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3M3QnxVe/versions/X9bSsrao/FishTank-1.0.2-1.20.4-fabric.jar","filename":"FishTank-1.0.2-1.20.4-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":350918,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"sPEM1on7","user":{"id":"rAaEWsp8","username":"U1timateJ7","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40703855?v=4","bio":"Developer for ArchedRing Modding, but I also make my own stuff too.","created":"2023-04-16T23:50:47.857089Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"FishTank-1.0.2-1.20.4-fabric.jar"},"mods\\Bountiful-7.0.2+1.20.4-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"c0936650fc69f777e24abe6415251eabd6a6a1e9ca4504428d9623a8804e418a2b685742dcbaaa982f10d2dbc3733adb44fd5142c77b7631ce761640c0eb97b0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"BpwWFOVM","slug":"bountiful","project_type":"mod","team":"qvvDCp9U","title":"Bountiful","description":"Adds bounty boards, giving rewards for collecting different blocks and items.","body":"# Bountiful\n\n \n\n#### This requires [Kambrik](https://modrinth.com/mod/kambrik)!\n\n***\n\n#### Bountiful is a mod centered around a single block called the Bounty Board, and items which appear within: Bounties!\n\n***\n\n\n \n\n### Mechanics:\n\nBounty boards can be found throughout the world in villages, and they'll generate bounties inside of them. These bounties often ask for you to bring back an item, or kill some mobs in return for whatever rewards they're offering. If you can complete the bounty, you just have to bring it back to the bounty board and right click the board to redeem your rewards!\n\n\n### Decrees\n\nThere exists another item as well, called a Decree. A Decree determines what kind of bounties show up on a bounty board. For example, an Armorsmith's Decree makes it so that objectives and rewards related to armor show up on the board (leather, iron, chestplates, boots, etc). You can have up to three decrees on a bounty board at once, and it will mix and match objectives and rewards from all three when new bounties appear!\n\nYou can find new Decrees as rewards for certain bounties, or make your own. Crafting your own will create a random decree when you place it onto the board.\n\n### Bounty Tiers\n\nJust like items, bounties can have different tiers of rarity. Some bounty rewards are more rare than others, and bounties with higher rarity have a better chance of having these more rare rewards! Rarity follows the same pattern as in vanilla: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic.\n\n### Reputation\n\nAll bounty boards have their own value associated with them called \"Reputation\". As you turn in more bounties, this number goes up! The higher the reputation, the more often rare bounties show up on the bounty board. Some bounty rewards may not even show up until you reach high enough reputations.\n\n### Compat\n\nCurrently, I've added some support for some items from different Fabric mods. Feel free to suggest compat with other Fabric mods (but I may be stingy! For example: I'm not likely to add compat with items that involve a lot of time to craft, since it may break progression for some modpacks).\n\n \n\nI plan on adding more in the future!\n\n### Why?\n\nI originally made this mod so that I could be given some goals to accomplish, which would stave off boredom. It gives players something to do when they're bored, and a fun way to incentivize crafting items they'd otherwise maybe not be making!\n\n### Help\n\nUntil the wiki is complete, you can get help on [my Discord server.](https://discord.gg/TCsRjJ6vwZ)\n\n#### Credits:\n\nAkiShirai, for the wonderful bounty board block art.","published":"2021-08-29T02:15:45.939419Z","updated":"2024-03-04T06:47:13.142048Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":384486,"followers":409,"categories":["adventure","economy","utility"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18-pre5","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["b745WfGi","FW2gMFWm","s7W0BcY3","yII7Bu5c","vMLc67VP","hYrrBKBT","qFqfFMMO","j44RssVC","RJHSMTU7","b9dZ8adN","2KAmOHQt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"2KAmOHQt","project_id":"BpwWFOVM","author_id":"HpLaZ9DK","featured":false,"name":"Bountiful 7.0.2+1.20.4-Fabric","version_number":"7.0.2+1.20.4","changelog":"[7.0.2] Fixed a crash when playing with both Lithium and Bountiful and entering a game.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-04T06:47:13.729504Z","downloads":5858,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b0a034c7e40e6cb2b6124adb38b6375b51c62aef","sha512":"c0936650fc69f777e24abe6415251eabd6a6a1e9ca4504428d9623a8804e418a2b685742dcbaaa982f10d2dbc3733adb44fd5142c77b7631ce761640c0eb97b0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/versions/2KAmOHQt/Bountiful-7.0.2%2B1.20.4-fabric.jar","filename":"Bountiful-7.0.2+1.20.4-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":606772,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"zfbCkvdZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qvvDCp9U","user":{"id":"HpLaZ9DK","username":"ejektaflex","name":"Ejektaflex","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23628421?v=4","bio":"I write code!

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

Downloads](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/fallingtree?logo=Modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingtree)\n\nThis mod will change the way you break trees. 4 modes are available:\n* Instantaneous: Break one log and the whole tree will fall\n* Shift down: Break a block and the log will slowly shift down as you cut it (good if you don't want to \"cheat\" too much but are lazy to go cut top log blocks 😛)\n* Fall items: Break one log and the whole tree will fall with an animation\n* Fall blocks: Break one log and the whole tree will fall on the floor with an animation\n\n![Demonstration of breaking a tree](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/raw/minecraft/1.20.1/assets/demo.gif)\n![Another demonstration of breaking a tree](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/raw/minecraft/1.20.1/assets/demo2.gif)\n\nSeveral options are available in the config file:\n\n* Customize what is considered as a tree (log blocks & leave blocks).\n* Customize what tools can be used (add more axes, allow everything, ...).\n* Turn leaf breaking on/off.\n* Option to disable the effect of the mod by sneaking (can be reversed).\n* Change speed depending on the tree size.\n* Damage tools or not (can set it to break the tool by the amount of blocks there were in the tree).\n* Let tools at 1 durability if it's going to break.\n\nCheck out the [wiki](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/wiki) for some more information.\n\n---\n\n* For Fabric users, **Fabric API** is required.\n* For Neoforge/Forge users, **Cloth Config API** is optional on the client and allows you to have a config GUI in game.\n\nNOTE: On servers this mod can be server-side only, client isn't required (except if you use the change speed feature and/or enchants configurations).","published":"2021-01-11T19:27:26.315086Z","updated":"2024-05-25T17:30:01.938548Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":1059403,"followers":1196,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","21w39a","21w43a","1.18-pre2","1.18","1.18.1","22w05a","22w06a","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2","22w13a","22w14a","22w17a","22w19a","1.19-pre5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","23w40a","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ClS5aGDu","by7f3jqu","wYPHBZnq","IvWeyNRf","ecFvHSSj","hYRTlWck","KA0lsBqm","frFjp7XE","Oy2HfoQu","HhiMtvaB","MBqZmh7k","rolL2W5j","VBOnAt36","fy6OOm9Q","PjU0ylA8","IjfKe2LK","BjxlB5ad","nDc9P6UR","T0QtOBLV","VlJQWF9M","4FktLQ41","QtHstonj","m2oM2Xzb","YBlmxpFC","Bhm08p1U","vT2GkHlJ","PCbggfQI","8h9olfhO","XpnXvmmg","1HEbx8wR","O7EzwYaR","k08wKfdA","K2xDwQMA","jHljfMeN","izrF4sw0","pM721YNG","48Uga7jj","RhvVV7aI","Wll71SI1","wm1VgWAh","Ge9TTua8","LI0g8wDL","UiUNxrl7","XzUcHIz2","MNaOu00H","EcPbQcBT","I4HjcOo5","hnXlvYfp","Brv0vjTc","GMOPXKvF","CaTPjokz","aMFJxIHm","qtfvfhdv","GS7o9NMO","1u6nezii","djHFleaq","Fn9hSpZQ","2qvQxa1B","ivSkiG78","TuLQv2oz","cvdeCtGH","8GR9mmKD","zv2J7DYl","1nneGSqI","mKpQdYKO","8XmHwXLO","LoJuqMMZ","9K3tdqQy","YMLyKqOj","k2geZqGH","3sdO7qgf","YlfhOTW2","iAX7H9LQ","LTbIi2M1","kgBh4dSx","bQrEMzOP","KRs7tr5H","dj8wmIBS","PgS4RtQX","Rcuv9i9M","9kSv8gsK","5DSiBB1r","qrxLiOcL","E4f85gRR","TIoBK1U1","2TNwaTtm","cMkbt0f5","NveCqCkX","BQ6i1U5X","rK4GkUX6","59SG26Fv","1TSCSQ4C","iszfrsgL","P55fppyL","XrkGy9Ky","reXqEJgT","yRWIgpnS","66mp0b9v","oXRivlMX","6KJqXkV0","frsJrlLk","kPSbFSaC","8q3U34GC","SQSRyVeT","BJ2K7C0J","NAMMnpkI","HojA8R8T","BdqBwLsv","NF3wLCFV","KW9Dm2r0","7vuduZD7","tOzqGtqB","7PRbBpzE","KRt1RhNH","akjkv5e2","Ua1F3TBl","H9oeRV3c","t9r6pZcy","snIN7mL9","Fi75hN4R","yr3p0Npt","HnH1cLYq","2u9Dpwhc","Gkt6UcDh","NrtzFkZE","BaMypQ7l","nZoL7IuF","mb15RrXi","2yoOOkuy","eEwiTLCR","1KVSR1de","twGJKI2m","l93ivqBS","WBPlgiIE","QpKTY6aW","oHSfaH3b"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Fb4jn8m6/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"mb15RrXi","project_id":"Fb4jn8m6","author_id":"fYPSlcba","featured":false,"name":"1.20.4-1.20.4.3","version_number":"1.20.4-1.20.4.3","changelog":"[Changelog

mod.\n\n</center>\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod prevents campfires from creating any particles when certain blocks are underneath them. It affects both standard and soul campfires. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is to prevent client-side lag and general annoyance when using large numbers of campfires in farms. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is a client-side mod, it will have no effect if installed on a dedicated server.\n\n<br />\n\nThe default list of blocks that suppress smoke is:\n```json\n\"suppressing_blocks_list\": [\n  \"minecraft:hopper\",\n  \"minecraft:rail\",\n  \"minecraft:activator_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:powered_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:detector_rail\"\n]\n```\n\n<br />\n\nBlocks can be added and removed either using [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) or by editing '.minecraft/config/smoke_suppression.json'\n\n<br />\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Translating</summary>\n\nIf you'd like to translate Smoke Suppression (there are only a few lines of text), follow [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/smoke-suppression/invite/). \n\nNew translations will be added once approved without the mod needing an update thanks to [CrowdinTranslate](https://github.com/gbl/CrowdinTranslate).\n\n</details>\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric (works on Quilt, too!) and I won't be porting it to Forge.

Support for this mod is provided on a \"best-effort\" basis. This is not my day job, it is a hobby growing out of related work I've done.\n\n## Sponsor Me!\n\nDid this mod make your server playable? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium. Support beyond these mods is provided on a best effort basis.","published":"2020-12-21T17:48:09.050177Z","updated":"2024-04-30T05:33:44.554246Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2761607,"followers":2832,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["tO4HJpLA","19624YsD","7AwqDL7J","Ff90AgU6","PGovBIXq","AXYWaIE8","kCiWZ1wv","QmrcLtH3","vJQ7plH2","UJ6FlFnK","vx0mZa04","Tncui9tU","jiDwS0W1","cQ60Ouax","X2k7QAQS","bRcuOnao","PYi5mm1G"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"bRcuOnao","project_id":"fQEb0iXm","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"Krypton 0.2.6","version_number":"0.2.6","changelog":"* Fixes a memory leak.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-02T01:58:52.570969Z","downloads":295188,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fc237a3cdf7cff71e222db8e14fa6d4546e2d000","sha512":"a3e4eadcd8074a0a68a1378c90824b58199bedbab2f7eaa3961db9b10b99215805dde4eb73be5ec3118f38fbb0beaa8a1b6f9de6966a741d32dbf181a44ae11b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/versions/bRcuOnao/krypton-0.2.6.jar","filename":"krypton-0.2.6.jar","primary":true,"size":167163,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LBcJZJkm","user":{"id":"y0WF9UR5","username":"astei","name":"Andrew Steinborn","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16436212?v=4","bio":"Sometime Minecraft modder, currently an software engineer at the fintech startup Ramp","created":"2020-12-21T14:36:31.896442Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"krypton-0.2.6.jar"},"mods\\Fishingreal-1.20.4-1.8.0.jar":{"sha512":"d4bfbc1c22640f144466c4fd87dd6e75e30d2bea619bb184768cd6997f15986b143b03992c936a0c836fce9171427e28ec8506404d8e7f96a283b73dd325fc47","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MIdaKqt7","slug":"fishing-real","project_type":"mod","team":"XXjIitfM","title":"Fishing Real","description":"Fish up real entities instead of the items!

It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2024-05-15T05:16:05.016498Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3459490,"followers":4742,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl","Fc7h8MWD","MfBeYvQa","84Zs6tNo","Ox1racg8","hI13Vg85"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Ox1racg8","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.2","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-15T05:15:39.883269Z","downloads":29313,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e86ca6386b3be5f1d95845b85cada2341258bc7fe71f82ae7fd13bf4b7e889ec048ee7e564f0ab6de8a777e44026d9539866da677fe1c774ce87e2deedbd0292","sha1":"1604e431b7ece673fff7b5d5c15ea0385ce9b33a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/Ox1racg8/continuity-3.0.0-beta.5%2B1.20.2.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":1009401,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"PepperCode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CdcF3lqY/24a325b36c3ce10dbc1a86cc68c5eeb212784b63.png","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\collective-1.20.4-7.60.jar":{"sha512":"372e6d6ae503fb090c06d49381106040232575f78def68a332bf5f28f86acdc54cd67edcbe8434b49b3f9a2a07d7059490f47c48bb7106676217033849785a45","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"e0M1UDsY","slug":"collective","project_type":"mod","team":"UTtoE2WS","title":"Collective","description":"🎓 Collective is a shared library with common code for all of Serilum's mods.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><center><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/description/header/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"838\" height=\"400\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://curseforge.com/members/serilum/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/curseforge.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/modrinth.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/patreon.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/youtube.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a></center></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Fabric version requires the <a style=\"font-size: 24px;\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fabric API</a>.<br /></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Collective is a shared library mod with common code for all of Serilum's mods.</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br /><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: #000000;\">It contains data and functions centralized in one place.

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-05-12T16:27:48.472824Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1659184,"followers":1733,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"mjuG4AYd","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.4 Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.26","version_number":"1.20-2.26-fabric","changelog":"- Improved compatibility with slots with custom stack limits (like in the Nether Chested mod).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-02T16:59:36.217330Z","downloads":158428,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d0faf200dda358efddad2d2809f646023f4dd06254572369e07f3bf33cb6941f0fcdb02db4675b30b4f3bd542cbf6196e135680ba91a2b74c2b071f34978e2d5","sha1":"6a6b977e671b1ab625e740fc70fb5300c21bb841"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","primary":true,"size":77943,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"92e908a8ac714509904a6b484a24c68a43569a28a4a2800d9ea1144c8de9476363707e40c7eb3739712a0c94312b244f014f8114ca83b668b55a4b7164f56abf","sha1":"42f757f20c9437f93aa9aa912519231db91e961c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65765,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar"},"mods\\lambdynamiclights-2.3.4+1.20.4.jar":{"sha512":"fe30491cf6f94c9672aa8a3941231773349268da7e06108d98e43f59d9c0323cbb5cebd9fabfde52bcd01dd061a4ffb2a69e02f8203aeb13f8a7fd4e8d0a3cdb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yBW8D80W","slug":"lambdynamiclights","project_type":"mod","team":"BEQmFKFk","title":"LambDynamicLights","description":"A dynamic lights mod for Fabric.","body":"# LambDynamicLights\n\n\n[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/LICENSE)\n![Environment: Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/environment-client-1976d2?style=flat-square)\n[![Mod loader: Fabric]][fabric] \n\nA dynamic lights mod for Quilt and Fabric.\n\n## 📖 What's this mod?\n\nIt's dark outside, extremely dark...\nYou can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,\nor a lantern to hold and see in the light...\n\nAnd this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.\nYou can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!\n\nThis mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft.

Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p

[Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v20.4.3-1.20.4] - 2024-01-22\n### Fixed\n- Fix `mods.toml` entries for NeoForge\n\n## [v20.4.2-1.20.4] - 2024-01-13\n### Changed\n- Implement `UnmodifiableConfigWrapper` for `IConfigSpec` adapters on NeoForge & Forge\n\n## [v20.4.1-1.20.4] - 2024-01-10\n- Huge internal restructure, including new publications for NeoForge (for using Forge configs) and Forge (for using NeoForge configs)\n- The Fabric publication still includes all classes for both config systems, the api package has been split from `fuzs.forgeconfigapiport.api.config` into `fuzs.forgeconfigapiport.fabric.api.forge` and `fuzs.forgeconfigapiport.fabric.api.neoforge`\n- The common module is no longer published as `forgeconfigapiport-common`, instead there are now two common publications which are `forgeconfigapiport-common-forgeapi` and `forgeconfigapiport-common-neoforgeapi`\n### Added\n- Added `disableConfigWatcher` config option to both `ForgeConfigSpec` and `ModConfigSpec`\n### Changed\n- Updated ForgeConfigSpec with changes from [MinecraftForge#9810](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/9810)\n### Fixed\n- Fixed `FileWatcher` hanging

It provides many of the same features as [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) while many new conveniences, like server-client config synchronization, added on top\n\n - A fully automatic [registration system](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/registration/) that is designed to be as generic as possible. It is simple and non-verbose to use for basic registries, yet the underlying API tree is flexible and can also be used for many custom registration solutions\n\n - [Item Group extensions](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/item-groups/) which allow for sub-tabs inside your mod's group as well as a host of other features like custom buttons, textures and item variant handling\n\n - A fully-featured [networking layer](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/networking/) with fully automatic serialization, handshaking to ensure client compatibility and a built-in solution for triggering parametrized particle events in a side-agnostic manner\n\n - Client-sided particle helpers that allow for easily composing multi-particle effects\n\n - Rich text translations, allowing you to use Minecraft's text component format in your language files to provide styled text without any code\n\n***\n\nowo is documented in two main ways:\n\n - There is rich, detailed JavaDoc throughout the entire codebase\n - There is a wiki with in-depth explanations and tutorials for most of owo's features over at https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/features/","published":"2021-09-30T20:46:31.667429Z","updated":"2024-05-01T20:01:03.685555Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1425429,"followers":646,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","21w43a","1.18-pre8","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["HyvkCi1L","4NeTD3y0","ERFRuuW5","IPVeGmcd","LmWOyXVW","flVS3RS0","PptbPV7y","1WqSpJvo","F6DR79FV","1E69wiMJ","eAlYR8cf","Jfd8qbEF","3Qzf5TkU","lT5Mm5fS","6LkUrYRt","vnSwwEYV","2QnmkZKc","q3Sxg4SA","i8cpzMnQ","GqwSx15g","aWqxWaL7","zVhs4uLj","WJsP5KWE","F4LqV8lu","aXMVV7gj","uAXx21D1","C46ht027","HqAtE0un","NzQ8iAeC","RV8F1iab","Dmqb8GqA","bJtMgK25","lEVNuJ3B","fr6mJFIx","JX2OM2ED","2yMO9WGE","yGLYmVnT","gsbvHClE","LI7k719Y","KMwbSA7v","gmwB5dLB","ORA8RfoA","T8DsELMD","5QgPEzLH","beTZr7PG","DgIYuFEF","m23n3uIM","zyOBB7J4","oLoJCrky","DYgDdRtg","rGwQL6vN","9NFjhCIH","LWhxwhvI","HYGIKGSR","HEZ55HbJ","CJ29u2GJ","Her7Z3CG","ueejHgQH","cFeG2MJS","5qH0boef"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ccKDOlHs/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Her7Z3CG","project_id":"ccKDOlHs","author_id":"qGOpk8Hs","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.3+] oωo -

In the context of this mod, it means fish will exhibit more realistic and dynamic group movements, making your aquatic environments come to life.\n\nIn particular, each fish will follow these three rules:\n- Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates\n- Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates\n- Cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates\n\n### Additional Resources\nYou can learn more about boids simulations here:\n- [Wikipedia - Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)\n- [Craig Reynolds' Boids

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

It's completely separate from the vanilla mechanic, taking inspiration from various Animal Crossing titles.\n\nTo get started, craft a **Rookie Rod** using a regular fishing rod as the base. Cast it like normal and you'll soon see a **fish shadow** orbiting around your bobber. Wait for a bite and **hold** to reel it in!\n\n---\n\n<center>\n  <img src=https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uxaMjp3X/images/e823cdfd6c4487131bfd4b5a6bc55f3910b9a008.png width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"A player reeling in a small fish in a lake.\"/>\n</center>\n\n---\n\n### Additional Features\n\n- **16** unique fish to catch, each with their own rarity and behavior\n  - Orbit range, striking speed, nibble amount, etc.\n- Plentiful new foods to cook\n- Reimagined Lure and Luck of the Sea enchantments\n- **3** new equipment pieces, each with special effects\n  - [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) integration included\n\n...and more!\n\n### A Small Note\n\n**Pescatore** is the Italian word for **fisher**. While this mod comes nowhere close to an accurate fishing experience, we're hoping it'll breathe new life into Minecraft's existing aquatic systems. Have fun!\n\n## License\n\nMIT © 2023 spadeteam","published":"2023-12-19T06:02:35.294540Z","updated":"2024-04-25T20:02:02.307252Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1507,"followers":41,"categories":["equipment","minigame","mobs"],"additional_categories":["food","game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["X6Nwdhrz","eev7frMZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uxaMjp3X/0ed51b2e9d7668fa9b3728ba494f133810ce2c0c.png"},"version":{"id":"X6Nwdhrz","project_id":"uxaMjp3X","author_id":"rtyJqzhz","featured":true,"name":"1.0.0","version_number":"1.0.0-beta.1+1.20.4","changelog":"Initial release!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-30T07:26:31.501638Z","downloads":1251,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"2657230ff4efa4f23fa62a02d78fe915b12614ea","sha512":"074a54007d53842de4b7eb9a642e2771eb5d1203b2105eb2d20e40c8b44cde5cfd5a5387a01d94cd1d738342e88e2a55d6568bd19359215d9964ee0acc31db0f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uxaMjp3X/versions/X6Nwdhrz/pescatore-1.0.0-beta.rel%2B1.20.4.jar","filename":"pescatore-1.0.0-beta.rel+1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":345505,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"5aaWibi9","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EkceKcDT","user":{"id":"7rrvWf7D","username":"VirtuaLilith","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86464979?v=4","bio":"she/her, I make art because it's fun","created":"2022-06-05T23:56:08.175224Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"EkceKcDT","user":{"id":"RJDuxV9o","username":"Trudle_","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/RJDuxV9o/d3a878ed4c020812e3211a3d7db8d6eb9a454140.png","bio":"hi","created":"2023-02-09T19:54:25.697927Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"pescatore-1.0.0-beta.rel+1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\emoji-type-2.2.3+1.20.4-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"d2cf06954419e683ed28132ff4060efa1cabdc942f9ad619ef7a74e15c2163d658eacc7f3463552674aa1860f069a111ccb9cd1970e14add1465e03124b1e32f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"q7vRRpxU","slug":"emoji-type","project_type":"mod","team":"W500OHL3","title":"Emoji Type","description":"Allows you to easily type emoji and emoticons in game.","body":"# 🙂 Emoji Type\n_We support 100+ symbols/emojis by default!_ <br>\n\nThis mod allows you to type some emoji/symbols more easily in Minecraft. To be clear, this mod (technically) does not add any emoji to the game, it only makes typing the ones _already in the game_ easier. For this reason, emoji typed will be visible to anyone else on a server and will still be there (on signs, books, etc) if you uninstall the mod. I can not absolutely guarantee all symbols/emoji will work on all servers, some servers have plugins that mess with chat and there is really nothing I can do about that. **This is a client-side mod. Installing it on a server won't do anything.**\n\n### Typing Emojis\nTo type an emoji in chat, simply type a \":\" (colon), after that a list of all possible emoji keywords will appear. Once you type a keyword it will be replaced with the corresponding emoji or symbol. If you want to type an emoji outside of chat (anvil, sign, etc) the list won't appear but the keywords all still work.\n\n### Gallery\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emoji-type/gallery\">**Images of example mod usage**</a>","published":"2022-02-01T16:35:05.166164Z","updated":"2024-05-07T20:44:05.161761Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":285025,"followers":352,"categories":["decoration","social","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["XdckHhpz","Ht2hM8Xq","UOUu888G","OClBPG5J","zI92sPKy","CK7AQM79","JrJcKrVe","cPZUFyn3","CEkPXkXm","qfTOKc0t","UcvY1ouv","LDTBjvLi","q3ICvlUh","vxFNEeJM","KeZkpifk","EG9qtsGU","sAVbywwx","fOQkMciT","56RYN3J9","vMemC90R","uI750kzO","SDBfBuH9","bOTB1mD7","TJdSeIXP","sDwPKoLM","J1r39edy","ZoSYDHSL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/q7vRRpxU/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"SDBfBuH9","project_id":"q7vRRpxU","author_id":"eD3uN1NK","featured":false,"name":"Fabric 2.2.3 1.20-1.20.4","version_number":"2.2.3+1.20.4","changelog":"- Update to new architectury plugin version\n- Add support for 1.20.3 and 1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-15T18:41:47.230793Z","downloads":40212,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d2cf06954419e683ed28132ff4060efa1cabdc942f9ad619ef7a74e15c2163d658eacc7f3463552674aa1860f069a111ccb9cd1970e14add1465e03124b1e32f","sha1":"4b6334a28479292aae9959396ea0f06f3f793e96"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/q7vRRpxU/versions/SDBfBuH9/emoji-type-2.2.3%2B1.20.4-fabric.jar","filename":"emoji-type-2.2.3+1.20.4-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":28447,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"W500OHL3","user":{"id":"rjT4u2Xf","username":"cyborgcabbage","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29862837?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-09-02T14:45:33.458699Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Original Creator","ordering":0},{"team_id":"W500OHL3","user":{"id":"eD3uN1NK","username":"Norbiros","name":"Norbiros","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89837724?v=4","bio":"Norbiros#0730","created":"2022-08-28T09:10:41.179374Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emoji-type-2.2.3+1.20.4-fabric.jar"},"mods\\fabric-language-kotlin-1.11.0+kotlin.2.0.0.jar":{"sha512":"afc292e199869b982f18bbad208fed4a1d95b2f4292e0cc422ee8116d1da1d91132f554ac0608e7c87959d7ede37c20293133c811986dcfc80a8648f29d13028","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Ha28R6CL","slug":"fabric-language-kotlin","project_type":"mod","team":"tn8Zu9Q7","title":"Fabric Language Kotlin","description":"This is a mod that enables usage of the Kotlin programming language for Fabric mods.","body":"This is a mod that enables usage of the Kotlin programming language for Fabric mods.\n\nNote: This does not add content!
