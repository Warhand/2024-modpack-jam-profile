Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://optifine.alternatives.lambdaurora.dev/)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire! Fire! Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-04-29T16:00:45.150007Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":10836675,"followers":13350,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"mhZtY2lR","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.8","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.5.8","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Fabric API 0.95.3+ when using High Contrast or Programmer Art resource packs.\n- Improved support for keyboard accessibility features in parts of the video settings screen.

Have you ever wished that you could make it more challenging without the glass cannon nature of the hard difficulty? Have you ever found fighting mobs boring and monotonous due to their simplistic nature?\n\nIf the answer to any of those questions is yes, this is the datapack for you. Upgraded Mobs is a datapack/server-side mod that adds new attacks, mechanics, and features to many of the mobs you know and love.\n\n### Details\nAll of the changes and additions in this project are detailed below.\n\n<details>\n<summary>All</summary>\nAll mobs have increased follow range, allowing them to see you from farther away. Their movement speed is also increased slightly to make running away a little bit harder.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Zombies</summary>\nZombies (including drowned, husks, and zombie villagers) receive two upgrades that make fighting a horde a little more threatening:\n\n- All zombies are capable of breaking doors, regardless of the difficulty.\n- Periodically, zombies will dash at a nearby player.\n- Unique to this dash is a bite attack that deals extra damage. This attack can be blocked, but be warned, it will eat through your shield quickly!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Drowned</summary>\nIn addition to the default zombie dash/bite, drowned get the following two changes:\n\n- Drowned swim faster now, on top of the default movement buff for all mobs.\n- If a player is above water, drowned will periodically pull them deeper underwater in an attempt to, well, drown them. This can even happen if you are traveling above them in a boat. Watch out for hordes!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Elder Guardians</summary>\nElder guardians have been upgraded to be full fledged boss mobs.\n\n- Elder guardians have 300 HP, same as the vanilla wither.\n- In combat, elder guardians will periodically debuff a random player with weakness, slowness, and/or blindness.\n- If no guardians are nearby, an elder guardian will periodically summon mini-guardians that disappear after a short time.\n- Below half HP, elder guardians will periodically turn invisible.\n- To compensate for all of this, the chance of dropping a Tide armor trim is increased to 100%.\n\nA video demonstrating this is shown below. It is slightly outdated, however, as instant damage on the periodic debuff has been removed. Coincidentally, it also demonstrates the new drowned features!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlpjHU2KDd8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Evokers</summary>\nEvokers are now mini-bosses that receive the following upgrades:\n \n- Evokers now have 150 HP, and while below half HP, they gain Regeneration 1.\n- Evokers also hold a totem of undying in their off-hand that must be popped before killing them. This doesn't change combat with them that much, but it does make sense thematically.\n- Whenever an evoker uses their fang attack, it will also follow up with two more waves of fangs in the same place.\n- To compensate for all of this, vexes now die immediately if there aren't any evokers nearby.\n\nFurthermore, two admin functions `upgradedmobs:evokers/raid_loot/enable` and `upgradedmobs:evokers/raid_loot/disable` are added. While enabled, evokers spawned during raids won't drop a totem anymore. Instead, they can drop golden apples, enchanted books, and lapis lazuli. This is disabled by default.\n</summary>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Piglin Brutes</summary>\nWhile their damage is untouched, piglin brutes now receive a few upgrades that make it harder to fight them than just knocking them back while you stand still:\n\n- Brutes have 75% knockback resistance by default.\n- Brutes will periodically dash at nearby players.\n- Brutes will *also* throw the closest player or wither skeleton high into the air. Watch out for lava!\n- Brutes have a small chance of spawning with random pieces of netherite armor, or with knockback on their axe.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Pillagers</summary>\nPillagers aren't holding back anymore.\n\n- Some pillagers will shoot weakness arrows or even firework rockets instead of regular arrows.\n- Some pillagers will also have Quick Charge II crossbows.\n- The above two upgrades are applied more often during raids.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Spiders</summary>\nEveryone *loves* spiders.\n\n- Spiders will periodically dash at nearby players.\n- They will also periodically trap the closest player in a cobweb. Remember to use a sword to break out!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Witches</summary>\nFor as rare as they are, witches are a little too easy.\n\n- Witches now have 60 HP.\n- Splash potions thrown by witches have a 25% chance of being lingering potions instead.\n- If a player is nearby, splash potions have a 10% chance of inflicting blindness.\n</details>\n\n### Configuration\nDon't like some of the features listed above? Want to adjust some of the probabilities? Want to give a modded mob some of these features? While there is no config file, you can open up the datapack ZIP to edit things yourself:\n\n- If you add a `#` symbol in front of a command in an `mcfunction` file, that line will be commented out and won't be ran.\n- You can integrate other mobs via the tag system. For example, if you have a mod that adds a new type of zombie, you can add it to the `upgradedmobs:zombies` entity tag. Note that you can also do this in an external datapack by adding the same tag file but with the `replace` key set to `false`.\n- This datapack includes a list of predicates for random probabilities. If you want to change a probability, you can replace the associated predicate with a different one, or make your own.\n- If you want to exclude individual mobs (e.g. custom bosses) from the features in this datapack to make sure nothing is overwritten, give them the `upgradedmobs.blacklist` tag.\n\nIf you want to uninstall this datapack, you can simply remove it from your world with no issues. However, buffs to HP, follow range and movement speed, and the like that were already made can't be reverted.\n\n### Credits\nI can't take credit for all of this. Below includes a few sources that I used while making this:\n- Some mechanics were taken from TheGayerest's old [Tougher Everything](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/tougher-everything/) and [Tougher Bosses](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/tougher-bosses-full-release/) datapacks, with permission given by the original author.\n- Some inspiration was taken from Kindred408's old [Smart Mobs](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/minecraft-but-mobs-are-smart/) datapack, although the actual implementation in this datapack is my original work.\n\n### Other Datapacks\nI recommend the following datapacks, in addition to this one:\n- [Vanilla Parity](https://modrinth.com/datapack/vanilla-parity) replaces the Wither with the Bedrock Wither.\n- The old datapacks [Blaze Tweaks](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blaze-tweaks/) and [Pillager Tweaks](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/pillager-tweaks/) by FlanDere allow blazes and pillagers to move backwards when a player approaches them, like crossbow piglins do (and forward, in the case of blazes).\n- My other packs! Check them out on my Modrinth page :)\n\nCompatibility-wise, this datapack should usually be fine. However, watch out for the following:\n- Datapacks like [Incendium](https://modrinth.com/mod/incendium) that have mobs or bosses with custom AI and features won't be overwritten (except for when this pack buffs a mobs HP and such), but this datapack's mechanics will also be applied, which may have unintended consequences. \n- For example, FlanDere also has a cool [Jumping Mobs](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/jumping-mobs-java-datapack-original-by-pheonixsc/) datapack, but dashes and jumps don't mix well (the mob can bounce really high accidentally).\n- Remember to give the `upgradedmobs.blacklist` tag to any mob that you don't want to be affected by this datapack.","published":"2023-07-16T21:30:03.271954Z","updated":"2024-05-29T17:44:26.459028Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":28605,"followers":166,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","mobs"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["Wcyiwkk8","WfWa7W5Z","byaVcmWw","B27Jdn1h","WYxx2C6V","RLvFCnae","rZ9JXMWZ","OLtpSLx7","ZkgXODwQ","Ho1Cb96h","34P8Wlp0","F16FOXz5","VO7FHcYq","FmMnnJfw","yfjLj5MK","cslakmgp","Qo6whabR","6kQgoxtY","OCMDeiMC","vthXuJMV","m4OVQv5L","KqFvKo2a","VOEKTgti","K47ySeCt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iaFWBDP2/93f7090381019e87d20aee342027af07a57fe73b.webp"},"version":{"id":"K47ySeCt","project_id":"iaFWBDP2","author_id":"gBflFHI3","featured":false,"name":"1.3.4 - Mod","version_number":"1.3.4+mod","changelog":"Prevents non-evoker-summoned vexes from being killed instantly (filters by `BoundX` property)\n\nFixes typo in pillager weapon upgrade\n\nStay tuned for the 1.21 update soon!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-29T17:44:27.346684Z","downloads":558,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"631d86400bf16dc015e3c623b987a121fe4dd099faff1c1fd1cb8f8edc5e3e42ab0a8a6b9c9b897fb0341a84eda11588c838067cc6b343351cde79d8ce4f7703","sha1":"60cb5d4d142607e8b2522405b6f85b3a71e70b6d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iaFWBDP2/versions/K47ySeCt/upgraded-mobs-1.3.4.jar","filename":"upgraded-mobs-1.3.4.jar","primary":true,"size":42696,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"3UJegn17","user":{"id":"gBflFHI3","username":"badooga","name":"badooga","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/gBflFHI3/eefdb6deb9611c85ebedfec41beca7bc94a20ff2.png","bio":"I make stuff sometimes.\n\nSocials: linktr.ee/badooga","created":"2023-04-25T06:34:27.528489Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"upgraded-mobs-1.3.4.jar"},"mods\\magicmirror-1.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"80efba7e570455ae661557351157c9ab8953a407566adc69815286d4fb693a80c836844569e40371fdbd3b4ed2cef339cf888176dc96f3b0945fdf0163e5e8b0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"1d2CrxHN","slug":"qds-magic-mirror","project_type":"mod","team":"oX4iTYEY","title":"Magic mirror","description":"This mod allows you to teleport to your respawn point!","body":"![Crafting](https://i.imgur.com/V9WICov.png)\n<center><b>This is little configurable mod will add a magic mirror from Terraria.</b><br>\n  <br>\n  Quilt, Fabric and Forge support!<br>\n  <br><a href=\"mailto:quitrindev@outlook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Give Feedback</a><br>\n</center>\n\n### Features:\n- Mod adds 2 types of magic mirrors from terraria: default and ice magic mirrors.\n- You can use magic mirrors only in overworld, if gamerule `magicMirrorWorksEverywhere` is `false`.

subtle overhaul of vanilla Overworld biomes","body":"![](https://i.imgur.com/yJbL99N.png)  \n\n### 🌲 About\n**Geophilic** is a data pack that improves vanilla Overworld biomes in a subtle and simple way! The main inspiration comes from scrapped illustrations for what was *supposed* to be the *Wild Update* - this is essentially meant to be a collection of light improvements to vanilla biomes without any new blocks, items, or even new biomes.  \n\nMain changes are made to the rarity and density of certain biome features, such as grass, fern, or flowers. New features are added too - rocks, fallen trees, moss, tree stumps, bushes, and sometimes new types of trees. Most trees are however left almost fully vanilla, with the only change being how tall naturally occurring trees generate, so you don't bump your head so often!  \n\nBasically, this isn't meant to be an epic terrain overhaul, but rather a simplistic and nice way to update the feel of vanilla biomes to the new standard, without making them feel too out of place.  \n\n### 📦 Content\n**1.0.0:** Taiga, Birch Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest, Desert, Flower Forest, Forest, Swamp, Windswept Forest and Windswept Hills  \n**1.1.0:** All above plus Dark Forest, Badlands, Savanna and Savanna Plateau  \n**1.2.0:** All above plus Plains  \n**2.0.0:** Badlands, Birch Forest, Dark Forest, Deep Ocean, Desert, Eroded Badlands, Flower Forest, Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest, Old Growth Pine Taiga, Old Growth Spruce Taiga, Plains, Savanna, Savanna Plateau, Snowy Plains, Snowy Slopes, Stony Shore, Sunflower Plains, Swamp, Taiga, Windswept Forest, Windswept Savanna, Wooded Badlands  \n\nSee the gallery for pictures!\n\n### 📝 Note\nThis mod **only affects vanilla biome files and adds configured and placed features**, which is important because it means it is compatible with other mods and data packs that change the way your terrain generates.

It reimplements some popular features from Auditory and includes all the sound effects from ExtraSounds, providing a rich and immersive soundscape for your game.\n\n# Features\n\n- **Over 35 Configurable Sound Effects:** Customize sound effects for various game events, including UI interactions, chat messages, and in-game actions.\n\n- **Dynamic Block and Item Sounds:** Enjoy unique sounds for all block items, with over 25 different sound categories handcrafted for more than 100 items, ensuring a well-crafted auditory experience.\n\n- **Resource Pack Compatibility:** Easily add dynamic sounds using resource packs, allowing for seamless compatibility with other mods.\n\n- **Data Generation APIs:** Utilize Sounds' data generation providers to add dynamic sounds within your own mods, enhancing customizability and flexibility.\n\n- **Sound Additions and Tweaks:** Sounds adds missing sound effects and tweaks existing ones that do not fit well in-game, creating a more cohesive audio environment.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkwF-D2qR30\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n# Configuration\n\nSounds offers a robust configuration system powered by YACL, providing an easy-to-use and navigable interface.\n\nAdjust settings to customize the mod's sound effects to your preferences.

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

width=25> **Keep Some Inventory**\n\n<font color=\"#14CC14\">**Isn't it annoying when you die and your items are far away and surrounded by danger?**</font>\n\nWith this data pack no longer, since you <font color=\"#14CC14\">**keep your fighting equipment**</font> like weapons, tools and armor <font color=\"#14CC14\">**on you when dying**</font>!\n\n## **Overview**\n**Personally I don't like** playing with the `keepInventory` gamerule set to `true` because it feels cheap to go somewhere dangerous **without the risk** of losing anything.\nThis data pack aims to give dangerous areas their **risk back** while still allowing you to **use your best equipment** that you spent hours on farming, crafting and enchanting.\n\n## **Features**\nWhen dying, you **keep all your equipment** on you while still **dropping your resources**.\n\n<details><summary>You will <b>keep these items</b>:</summary>\n<li><b>Armor</b>, <b>Elytra</b>, Heads, Skulls and Carved Pumpkins\n<li><b>Tools</b> and <b>Weapons</b> including Trident, Flint and Steal and Fishing Rods\n<li>Clocks, Compasses and <b>Recovery Compasses</b>\n<li>All Golden Apples, Potions and Totems\n<li>Every type of Arrow, all Torches and Firework Rockets\n<li>Ender Pearls and Ender Eyes\n<li>Goat Horns, Spyglasses, all Maps and all Buckets\n<li>All types of Boats, Minecarts, Saddles and Horse Armor\n<li>Written Books and Writable Books (Book and Quill) \n<li>Carrots on a Stick and Warped Fungi on a Stick\n</details><br>\n\nYour items **will not splatter**, they all stay at the exact location you died at, **no items flying into lava or off of cliffs**.\n\nAt the location of your death you can collect **all your experience** and it is **not limited** to about 7 levels, like in vanilla minecraft.\n\nAfter dying, your **items will despawn after 10 minutes** instead of despawning after the normal 5 minutes.<br>\n➔ _the time items take to despawn can be modifed using the [config](#configure-the-pack)_\n\n## **Configure the Pack**\nIf you are an admin or have cheats enabled, you can easily **configure the data pack's behavior** by running the following command:\n```mcfunction\nfunction ps-keep:config\n```\nThat will **open this menu in the chat**:\n\n![config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PuckiSilver/KeepSomeInventory/main/images/config.png)\n\nYou can then **change the values by clicking on the text**.\n\n<details><summary>The <b>configuration options</b>:</summary>\n<code>Item despawn offset</code>, is the <strong>time removed</strong> from the default 5 minutes\n<strong>despawn timer</strong> in ticks\n<ul>\n    <li>The default is <code>-6000</code> ticks, with this you get <strong>5 minutes extra</strong>, so your\n        items despawn after 10 minutes</li>\n    <li>Setting it to <code>5999</code> will mean, that they despawn after just a <strong>single tick</strong>\n    </li>\n    <li>If you set it to <code>-32768</code>, items after death will stay for <strong>over 32 minutes</strong>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<code>Keep Experience</code> determines <strong>if experience will drop</strong>\n<ul>\n    <li>If the setting is at it's default <code>0</code>, you will <strong>drop all</strong> of your experience\n        where you died</li>\n    <li>When it is set to <code>1</code>, you <strong>keep all</strong> your experience with you, like how the\n        <code>keepInventory</code> gamerule works</li>\n</ul>\n<code>Keep Items</code> determines what items will drop\n<ul>\n    <li>If the setting is at it's default <code>1</code>, you <strong>only drop resources but no\n            equipment</strong> <br>\n            <em>(you can see all items that are kept <a href=\"#features\">here</a>)</em></li>\n    <li>You will <strong>drop all your items</strong> by setting it to <code>0</code>, but keeping the\n        <strong>experience</strong>, that items <strong>don't splatter</strong> and the <strong>item despawn\n            time</strong> will still apply as expected</li>\n    <li>If the setting is set to <code>2</code>, you will <strong>keep all your items</strong> while still being\n        able to drop your experience</li>\n</ul>\n</details><br>\n\nIf you want to **adjust what items you keep or drop on death**, you can **modify** the `drop_on_death` item tag at `/data/ps-keep/tags/items/drop_on_death.json`.<br>\nAll the items listed in this tag **will be dropped on death**, so if you want to **keep a specific item**, that you normally drop, just **remove it's entry** from this list.\n\nWhen **building the data pack from source**, you can easily adjust the items by modifying the [`drop_on_death.bolt`](https://github.com/PuckiSilver/KeepSomeInventory/blob/main/src/data/ps-keep/modules/drop_on_death.bolt) file.\n\n---\n[![PuckiSilver on

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-05-29T16:56:29.745738Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3657339,"followers":3532,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b","1.21-pre1","1.21-pre2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR","jeq5Pk2P"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"48hFxWw7","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.3","version_number":"3.4.3","changelog":"Changes:\n\n-

These bounties often ask for you to bring back an item, or kill some mobs in return for whatever rewards they're offering. If you can complete the bounty, you just have to bring it back to the bounty board and right click the board to redeem your rewards!\n\n\n### Decrees\n\nThere exists another item as well, called a Decree. A Decree determines what kind of bounties show up on a bounty board. For example, an Armorsmith's Decree makes it so that objectives and rewards related to armor show up on the board (leather, iron, chestplates, boots, etc). You can have up to three decrees on a bounty board at once, and it will mix and match objectives and rewards from all three when new bounties appear!\n\nYou can find new Decrees as rewards for certain bounties, or make your own. Crafting your own will create a random decree when you place it onto the board.\n\n### Bounty Tiers\n\nJust like items, bounties can have different tiers of rarity. Some bounty rewards are more rare than others, and bounties with higher rarity have a better chance of having these more rare rewards! Rarity follows the same pattern as in vanilla: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic.\n\n### Reputation\n\nAll bounty boards have their own value associated with them called \"Reputation\". As you turn in more bounties, this number goes up! The higher the reputation, the more often rare bounties show up on the bounty board. Some bounty rewards may not even show up until you reach high enough reputations.\n\n### Compat\n\nCurrently, I've added some support for some items from different Fabric mods. Feel free to suggest compat with other Fabric mods (but I may be stingy! For example: I'm not likely to add compat with items that involve a lot of time to craft, since it may break progression for some modpacks).\n\n \n\nI plan on adding more in the future!\n\n### Why?\n\nI originally made this mod so that I could be given some goals to accomplish, which would stave off boredom. It gives players something to do when they're bored, and a fun way to incentivize crafting items they'd otherwise maybe not be making!\n\n### Help\n\nUntil the wiki is complete, you can get help on [my Discord server.](https://discord.gg/TCsRjJ6vwZ)\n\n#### Credits:\n\nAkiShirai, for the wonderful bounty board block art.","published":"2021-08-29T02:15:45.939419Z","updated":"2024-03-04T06:47:13.142048Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":411879,"followers":417,"categories":["adventure","economy","utility"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18-pre5","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["b745WfGi","FW2gMFWm","s7W0BcY3","yII7Bu5c","vMLc67VP","hYrrBKBT","qFqfFMMO","j44RssVC","RJHSMTU7","b9dZ8adN","2KAmOHQt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qFqfFMMO","project_id":"BpwWFOVM","author_id":"HpLaZ9DK","featured":false,"name":"Bountiful 6.0.3+1.20.1-Fabric","version_number":"6.0.3+1.20.1","changelog":"### Added\n- Implemented the new item group system, so that items will once again show up in creative tabs, as well as in JEI.\n- Added processor lists, so that bounty boards can generate with a different look depending which village it generates in.\n- Added Numismatic Overhaul compat for Fabric.\n- Updated translations.\n- Added a default single localization override for Decrees\n### Fixed\n- Fixed the \"missing ops\" cosmetic issue upon world load.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-17T23:19:01.980803Z","downloads":312261,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"147065ea9b24a43d11a6b22fec9733f011695f1ce8e164037185eb3e29f6c7c01787f193f6c0b614ff9c83c07db811567e3842afe2c88bbf39dc2664bd2d029d","sha1":"d8e5e67712a8b683ae07101a51ad53df0fb24e63"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/versions/qFqfFMMO/Bountiful-6.0.3%2B1.20.1-fabric.jar","filename":"Bountiful-6.0.3+1.20.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":529853,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"s7VTKfLA","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"s10JMAtS","project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"SqVitkHr","project_id":"zfbCkvdZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qvvDCp9U","user":{"id":"HpLaZ9DK","username":"ejektaflex","name":"Ejektaflex","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23628421?v=4","bio":"I write code!

But most of all, it offers an abstraction layer for developing mods on both the Forge and Fabric mod loader, making ports and maintaining mods rather simple without having to rewrite a bunch of logic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This mod doesn't do anything on its own, so install it only when you also use another one of my mods.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Fabric version of this project additionally depends on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Forge Config API Port</strong></span></a> library. This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names. Check the <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Minecraft Wiki</strong></span></a> for more information on formatting codes.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/27/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/28/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anvils can be so fancy!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Free name tag renames</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/29/2022-09-29_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/30/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No max level limit anymore</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>No anvil required for renaming name tags anymore</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/422/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/424/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Repair anvils by one stage using iron blocks</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use formatting codes when naming your equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want enchanting tables to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Magic</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before 1.17?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Check out the mods which inspired this project: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Tweaks</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-repair\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Repair</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nametags-without-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nametags Without Anvils</span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>tfarecnim</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

Well, now that's possible! MC Dungeons Weapons (MCDW) aims to bring all of these weapons, and more, from Minecraft Dungeons to Minecraft.\n\n# Content\n![An image of multiple rows and columns showcasing the weapons from MC Dungeons Weapons](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FZmGDE43/images/ce47b733d99279758a579a1da74a42228844cf14.png)\nRight now, there are about 150 weapons added to the game ranging from flails to katanas to crossbows and bows. They all have crafting recipes in the Vanilla Recipe Book and they show up in Recipe Viewers such as [Roughly Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) or [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi). Whilst Recipe Viewers are not necessary, they are <em>HIGHLY</em> recommended.\n\n## Related Mods\nWould you like weapons as well? Well, check out [MC Dungeons Armors](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcda)!\n\nWould you like artifacts as well? Well, check out [MC Dungeons Artifacts](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcdar)!\n\nDo you like the enchanting style of Dungeons? Check out [MC Dungeons Enchanting](https://modrinth.com/mod/mc-dungeons-enchanting)!\n\n[![Banner and link indicating sponsorship by Bisect Hosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/9deaa8f0-11c2-41f1-8f4f-32d2493b0912.png)](https://www.bisecthosting.com/Timefall)\n\n# Attributions/Special Thanks\nMC Dungeons Weapons could not have ever existed without the amazing people mentioned below. They were instrumental to the inspiration and education needed to produce MC Dungeons Weapons and the rest of MCDX (the MC Dungeons Suite).\n\n## SeaOfPixels\nThe continuing improvement to the visuals of this mod would not be possible without [Sea of Pixels](https://powerups4u.wixsite.com/seaofpixels). He has licensed his amazing art for MC Dungeons Weapons and has worked with us to balance out some of the issues with MCDW as well. SeaOfPixels has allowed for his amazing models and textures from his resource pack [New Default+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/newdefaultplus) to be used in MCDW. Please show him some support and check it out! If you like CIT texture packs, I'm sure that you'll have a blast!\n\n## Kai1907\nThis mod was inspired by the amazing CIT texturepack by Kai1907, which allows you to have (at least visually) these weapons as well as a variety of other items. Kai1907 allowed for his art to be used in the earlier versions of this mod. Please show him some support and check out his [awesome texturepack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/minecraft-dungeons-textures-for-minecraft-java-edition/) and his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDWE3OLgQv5w8E0WcNrzWyA).\n\n## LordDeatHunter\nFor helping with a massive amount of aspects of MCDW including the configs and teaching Chronos many of the foundations of Java. LordDeatHunter is probably most well known for [Fabric Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones), which is definitely worth checking out!\n\n## BackupCup\nCup is an amazing pixel artist and is a budding Kotlin programmer. Thanks to them, we have a new suite of icons for MCDX and the icon for MCDW is thanks to them! Please check out their projects [here](https://modrinth.com/user/BackupCup)!\n\n# Localisations/Translations\nWould you like to have MC Dungeon Weapons translated into your language?

This is not a bad thing, in and of itself; but it makes it almost impossible to troubleshoot anything whilst still respecting the licencing that sp614x uses. So, out of respect for them so as to not have to explore their code without permission, we simply do not support it. Please consider the following alternatives:\n    - FPS Enhancement and Optimisations -- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) (Fabric); [Rubidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium) (Forge)\n    - Shaders -- [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) (Fabric); [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) (Forge)\n    - Rendering Compatibility -- [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) (Fabric); [Reforgium](https://modrinth.com/mod/reforgium) (Forge)\n- Q: Can I use your mod in my modpack?\n  - A: Absolutely! I only ask that you provide a link back to this page.\n- Q: I've seen your mod on other sites. Did you post it and are they safe?\n  - A: I have not, nor do I plan to, post my mod on any other sites than Modrinth, Curseforge or our GitHub page. If you have downloaded this mod from somewhere else: \n    1. It isn't from us \n    2. It may have some kind of malicious files or have been modified in some way. I urge you to delete the file, run a full virus and malware scan and, if you want to use MC Dungeons Weapons, come and download it on Modrinth, CurseForge or from GitHub.\n- Q: 1.12.2?\n  - A: No, just no.</p>\n- Q. Forge?\n  - A. MC Dungeons Weapons is compatible with Forge by using the following mods: [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector), [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras) and the [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) which are being developed by Su5eD. Please make sure to follow all of their instructions in order to have the best experience. If you wish to use [Clumps](https://modrinth.com/mod/clumps), please make sure to use the Fabric version as we rely on a method that is not present in the Forge version.","published":"2023-11-12T22:32:16.148279Z","updated":"2024-04-21T16:41:28.330335Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":140225,"followers":116,"categories":["adventure","equipment","magic"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["F4Nb4xBv","NVyPECBw","AhyZP1zF","O8JgP5eC","yybXHLu2","S2yuB3CX"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FZmGDE43/278575796297e7198422c51c8096ed7dba613bf1.png"},"version":{"id":"S2yuB3CX","project_id":"FZmGDE43","author_id":"RKeVc148","featured":false,"name":"MC Dungeons Weapons 9.0.4","version_number":"9.0.4","changelog":"-- Bug Fixes ---\n- Fixed an edge case where innate enchantments attempt to be applied, even when all items are disabled","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-21T16:41:29.607253Z","downloads":16698,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3412ce494badd3b583d2f7c9a3460511db38d11b","sha512":"f9c1b28dccde38841f66e492d73bfa72aaaa87a8f83afebff9b636c2ab832ab1bf062e20fe956023929b0af03e42079749e3fb5318073f9feafff0287ce066f0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FZmGDE43/versions/S2yuB3CX/mcdw-9.0.4.jar","filename":"mcdw-9.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":1494390,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"5sy6g3kz","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"AqaIIO6D","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Aqlf1Shp","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ENZmbSFZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"FYpiwiBR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Wnxd13zP","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nfn13YXA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"u58R1TMW","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Rw4Hj7fl","user":{"id":"RKeVc148","username":"Chronos_Sacaria","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67794130?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-05-25T14:37:02.079073Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"mcdw-9.0.4.jar"},"mods\\starterstructure-1.20.1-3.6.jar":{"sha512":"1cc499938cccd56f6b912cb6269e1a6233c469f3b17cf5d2cdf3785bf317d0a5e2431a0c97faf102b59994114d44f0fab471a6539fe66c60d6323e1aa4cb4890","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gi80Z09B","slug":"starter-structure","project_type":"mod","team":"HdAKZrCN","title":"Starter Structure","description":"🏛️ Allows the creation of buildings on initial world generation at spawn via schematic files.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><center><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/description/header/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"838\" height=\"400\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://curseforge.com/members/serilum/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/curseforge.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/modrinth.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/patreon.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/youtube.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a></center></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Requires the library mod&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:24px\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/collective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collective</a>.</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-size:8px\"><br></span><br>Starter Structure adds the possibility to generate a specific structure when a world is first being generated.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-05-25T20:34:39.856745Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6564893,"followers":5024,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"frGGaFrx","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.5-1.20.1 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.5","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Backport latest build down to 1.20.1\r\n* Fix \"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\" sometimes showing up in logs\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.4-1.20.6...1.6.5","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-25T20:34:05.225978Z","downloads":39991,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3a671efcdd85c431c933b84868373afd05b5fc16","sha512":"00009f1762657d252fba9ac42d67f29376ec3e3082befebeba4a8d1635fd71f76f309ed766fa36d407213357d2f21ab6dc26cbe44ddac9d636cca9896a02111d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/frGGaFrx/entityculling-fabric-1.6.5-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.5-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":64981,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":null,"bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

The reason why it's available separately is to keep Xaero's Minimap as light-weight as possible. <strong>This mod is mostly client-sided.

Please report any bugs that you encounter or otherwise they probably won't get fixed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure your world is optimized (<em>Singleplayer - Edit - Optimize World</em>) for the Minecraft version you're playing (repeat after every Minecraft update).

Open the map screen by&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">pressing M</strong>. Move the map around with your mouse and zoom in/out using the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mouse wheel</strong>, similar to Google Maps.

In the waypoint menu, you can see a list of all your map waypoints from the rendered sets, interact with them with the mouse cursor, filter them by name in a text field. The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set. Hovering over the waypoints in the menu also acts as hovering over them on the map: they are highlighted on the map and you can use the right-click or hover controls to interact with them.</li>\n<li>An option to export a map as a PNG image file. The mod tries to export the whole map, so it might not work, if the map is millions of blocks in length. I'm planning to give more options for exporting the map in the future!</li>\n<li>Option to limit your map access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add&nbsp;<em>mapItemId:minecraft:compass&nbsp;</em>anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the map will not work unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; text-decoration: underline;\">Get Xaero's Minimap</span></a></p>\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?\n\n<p>First, exit the server and locate the Minecraft game directory that you're using to play on the server. In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-05-12T16:27:48.472824Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1770904,"followers":1769,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"mjuG4AYd","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.4

various treasure items that can be found through exploration","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochotonida/artifacts/1.18/src/main/resources/logo.png)\n\nSome older versions of this mod can be found on curseforge: [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts) /  [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts-fabric)\n\nArtifacts is a mod which aims to make exploration more rewarding by adding various powerful items that cannot be crafted.\n\nThe items added by this mod can be found in chests in vanilla structures, through archaeology, or can very rarely be found worn by entities. All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items and their descriptions can be found in the images tab. Sn up-to-date list of where each item can be found is available on the wiki on GitHub.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack. Information about the data formats used can be found on the [Trinkets wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Trinkets-Data-Formats).\n\n#### _Which mod are you using to put artifacts on armor stands?_\n\n[Curious Armor Stands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curious-armor-stands \"\").\n\n#### _Can I still find artifacts if I add this mod to a world that has already been generated?_\n\nCampsites and mimics will only spawn in chunks that were generated after you downloaded the mod. You will still be able to find artifacts in unopened chests in existing chunks.\n\n#### [Forge] _Whey I try to open the Curios menu to equip my artifacts, nothing happens._\n\nSome server plugins can cause this (https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/issues/131). If you're using plugins, verify that this issue also happens in a Forge-only environment before asking for help.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/298798089068609537/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/87pXJadaRr)","published":"2022-06-14T16:56:58.872057Z","updated":"2024-06-02T07:47:29.901291Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":371839,"followers":477,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["vtfSrjwt","enKgSs94","mPPkxtPE","tr5a9mT8","e4CTWqPl","fSw9kqQh","V8ExzIs5","NyF72ZGD","o0rov6DO","qXHbzxWN","3uzmjVVv","qrgK6WbC","qYmael6x","aR9WUkuw","jNhlay28","l9VPEvbV","V30gGFiR","mqynvjMF","M29wAfi3","lEZPMdyg","NZW4ytS1","Mx3Od65u","v3E2bsYR","1DMHqctP","bJzHzT51","6DXOR2pO","b349kUSi","Czb4tu7o","bfIQoQHe","r3FHm0nE","bbR3MLn5","9LAXM8mY","DcVGTlgT","KmlubFpZ","IvSt1a0t","TdKHoxTe","IfIR5Ism","QocOGlCW","2GfgtAam","4dYkst1S","sHrGzycI","PebrQais","zdWM9d47","iyqyMkD3","9Kojdc30","DDQl0gcS","xSYcBxz1","e7pOMiUY","X7e1GWpM","edfEyLZL","yD2sUuih","EH6eSF3G","ssCNWbE6","Uetdhalv","lswKVrnX","dPhbqtM6","Odf79yb4","xGYyX1il","EAwGZiN8","9t7hc6bZ","AoKWNF4Z","LIJxLjYS","Ajy5hbi6","ybE3XjDX","WvvsDJxJ","gbxaQJBL","X75XmT50","8mZ5UnPo","U2iHcp5o","VlULYp87","2zjahdfM","gJMeLEjq","uYKiAW2x","X4J7A9Jl","bm5Am3Lg","1O1JZK36","Ua6Apv5x","SeeTaJsQ","VfXXlUYc","coaHNDhc","ZtCX7QxR","fcNXNA2P","CibbmvD9","ybdJhvVc","ZunWeb9t"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/P0Mu4wcQ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"fcNXNA2P","project_id":"P0Mu4wcQ","author_id":"Q50e8wKr","featured":false,"name":"Artifacts

mod.\n\n</center>\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod prevents campfires from creating any particles when certain blocks are underneath them. It affects both standard and soul campfires. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is to prevent client-side lag and general annoyance when using large numbers of campfires in farms. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is a client-side mod, it will have no effect if installed on a dedicated server.\n\n<br />\n\nThe default list of blocks that suppress smoke is:\n```json\n\"suppressing_blocks_list\": [\n  \"minecraft:hopper\",\n  \"minecraft:rail\",\n  \"minecraft:activator_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:powered_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:detector_rail\"\n]\n```\n\n<br />\n\nBlocks can be added and removed either using [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) or by editing '.minecraft/config/smoke_suppression.json'\n\n<br />\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Translating</summary>\n\nIf you'd like to translate Smoke Suppression (there are only a few lines of text), follow [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/smoke-suppression/invite/). \n\nNew translations will be added once approved without the mod needing an update thanks to [CrowdinTranslate](https://github.com/gbl/CrowdinTranslate).\n\n</details>\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric (works on Quilt, too!) and I won't be porting it to Forge.

Adds an option to choose the crafting result if more than one is available.","body":"Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder.

Tridents</strong> brings some small, but much need improvements to tridents. Especially the loyalty enchantment is much more useful, and there's even a crafting recipe for tridents themselves!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Tridents Finally Have A Crafting Recipe!</strong> No longer will you solely receive this ancient weapon from a reskinned zombie: Every noticed how there are three elder guardians in an ocean monument, and a trident has exactly three jags? Well, that's not a coincidence anymore! Each elder guardian will drop a <strong>Trident Fragment</strong>; combine those with a few prismarine shards, and there's your brand new trident!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But what do you do when your trident is about to run out of durability? Simple: <strong>Repair It With Some Prismarine Shards</strong> using an anvil! Why do you even ask, that's obvious, isn't it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Let's talk about the loyalty enchantment: So your trident comes back to you, nice. But where does it go? Somewhere in your inventory to dig up again? And when you throw it into the void in the End, it's just gone. And what about all the fancy loot from the mobs you've slain, you need to go over there to collect it. Really? Well, all fixed: Tridents always return to the slot they are thrown from (even without loyalty), when thrown into the void they return, and any loot dropped by mobs will come flying at you together with the trident itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Besides that, <strong>Impaling Works As It Does On Bedrock Edition</strong>: any mob in contact with water or rain will receive increased damage. This is especially great, since tridents now finally work against those annoying drowneds infesting your beautiful oceans.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/965/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/966/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tridents with loyalty collect all drops for you</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Your trident is damaged?

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

It was designed for modpack creators to remove undesired entities that may unbalance the game or\n\ncreate issues.\n\n \n\n- Can I still make the entities spawn?\nNo, once a mob is added to the blacklist, there is no way to spawn it by any method.\n\nBoth natural or through eggs/commands. This mod is meant to completely remove undesired entities\n\n \n\n- Client or server?\nEverything happens on the server's side. Though it is recommended to leave the mod and config for clients too,\n\nfor the case they want to play a single player world. You should always leave this mod in the server pack alongisde its config.\n\n \n\n- What if I add an entity to blacklist that was already spawned?\nSpawned entities will still exist, so it's up to you if you want to kill them or not.\n\nFor this reason it's recommended to configure the mod before creating a world \n\n \n\n- What if I mispell an entitity's ID in the config file?\nNothing will happen. Adding invalid ID's won't cause issues, but obviously the entity won't be blacklisted\n\nas it technically doesn't exist. Same thing would happen if the mod isn't present, but it will be if it's added later and the ID is valid.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nExample Configuration:\n\nConfiguration is as simple as adding JSON entries for each entity you want to prevent from spawning.\n\nEntities can be from vanilla or any mod, you just have to add the id with the proper namespace, like minecraft:slime\n\nIt's located inside the config folder, with the file \"ysns.json\"","published":"2023-04-27T01:27:39.960103Z","updated":"2023-11-23T07:27:00.846687Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":233072,"followers":66,"categories":["management","mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["optimization"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["sRUWI3ip","BqJVrHr1","iqO3BQiY","zchsw4Z8","So46vAEN"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EjXcpmEA/dd9dcfd02df9dd385be8ce1a99b5dc9e9b33aae5.png"},"version":{"id":"So46vAEN","project_id":"EjXcpmEA","author_id":"Kp5oK4eX","featured":false,"name":"You Shall Not Spawn! 1.0.5","version_number":"1.0.5","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-23T07:27:01.802236Z","downloads":168743,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fa375e687e617c6efbc2b7791eeaacf418d8a456","sha512":"2a18943f954c5ad024c614cdf227f995df447b962ed91745af70362b85ea8d89bc4c537d628812e9c26788d5df0a335c505b50d484979e1ba9351478ceeb1598"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EjXcpmEA/versions/So46vAEN/YSNS-Fabric_Quilt-1.0.5.jar","filename":"YSNS-Fabric_Quilt-1.0.5.jar","primary":true,"size":7805,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"K9MP0gCT","user":{"id":"Kp5oK4eX","username":"ElocinDev","name":"Nicole","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Kp5oK4eX/e5c22c1a3b936e38de559ce58eec20f6a766470b.png","bio":"Mod developer working @ Luna Pixel Studios","created":"2022-11-10T10:48:24.447467Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"K9MP0gCT","user":{"id":"GpOHZG9G","username":"LunaPixelStudios","name":"Luna Pixel Studios","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135580893?v=4","bio":"https://discord.gg/LunaPixel","created":"2023-06-05T06:00:30.865746Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Studio","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"YSNS-Fabric_Quilt-1.0.5.jar"},"mods\\whatdurability-1.20.1-1.0.jar":{"sha512":"975ac78cb8f172b6ccb0dacd04402fe6e2597be5c3d4d91e60e203c5e6da7f93067705bda43f26e2b6e202575784a7059fb9ed56e16b788a9f5b69e1237666fb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lKY2kyjj","slug":"what-durability","project_type":"mod","team":"Dfx1atRm","title":"What Durability?","description":"❌ Removes all durability from items, allowing infinite uses.

The new statistics screen features an easier to navigate and read UI layout, as well as a few filters and a search field that will help you find the statictics you need a lot easier, especially when there are dozens, if not hundreds of entries to keep track of.\n\n### Dependencies (v3.9.7+)\nNote that \"client\" refers to installing mods to the game launched through a Minecraft launcher, whereas \"server\" refers to installing mods to a server you join through the \"multiplayer\" menu.\n\n| Requirements | Client | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Better Statistics Screen](#) | Optional | Optional |\n| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) | Required as of `1.20.5` | Required as of `1.20.5` |\n| [TCDCommons API](https://modrinth.com/mod/Eldc1g37) | Optional | Optional |\n| [Roughly Enough Items (REI)](https://modrinth.com/mod/nfn13YXA) | Optional | Not needed |\n| [Mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mOgUt4GM) | Optional | Not needed |\n\n## Features\nThis mod aims to improve on the existing features, as well as add additional features that may futher be helpful in tracking and managing one's statistics.  \n  \nNote that any optional features that this mod adds to the game, such as the \"/statistics\" command and the \"Stat announcement system\", may be disabled in the config or though the in-game mod settings menu.\n\n### The `/statistics` command\n**Alt command:** `/stats`  \nThis is an optional feature that adds a command that allows people (with sufficient permission levels, such as OP) to manage and view player statistics through commands. This feature may also be useful for writing datapacks that may wanna read as well as manage player statistics.  \n\n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*\n\n**The command syntax is the following:**\n- `/statistics clear <targets>`\n- `/statistics edit <targets> <stat_type> <stat> (set|increase) <value>`\n- [ex. general stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:custom minecraft:jump set 123`\n- [ex. item stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:used minecraft:wooden_shovel set 123`\n- [ex. mob stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:killed minecraft:zombie set 123`\n\n### The \"Stat announcement system\"\nThis is an optional server-sided feature that broadcasts special messages when players do certain things or achieve certain stats or \"milestones\". As of `v3.9.7`, the SAS announces when players achieve certain stats for the first time, such as for example \"Mining their first diamond\", or \"Crafting their first item of a specific type\", and so on..  \n  \n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*  \n  \n![The SAS in action](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/assets/66475965/3467ecae-5393-4fa9-9bf3-5146cc07f7b7)\n\n### The \"General\" statistics tab\nThis tab does not add nor show anything special regarding general statistics other than the redesigned UI layout. The filters menu features a way for you to hide all general statistics that are currently set to '0', as well as a search bar that will help you look for a specific statistic.  \n  \n![General statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/f612dcb73d9e4ffc4ca0494559a31221396c2435.png)\n\n### The \"Items\" statistics tab\nThe items tab displays items in a visual grid of items, similar to how an inventory screen does it. The items are categorized in item groups, just like they would be in the creative inventory menu. All items you interacted with are shown in this tab. This will hopefully help you find the items you are looking for easier. The search field in the filters menu can be used to look for specific items. To see a statistic for an item, place your cursor over the said item, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard, and a tooltip text will display the statistics. The \"Show item names\" checkbox defines whether or not the tooltip will also show the item name.  \n  \n![Item statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5ef05e79400d4e0d386f899dc1849f72731c0372.png)\n\n### The \"Mobs\" statistics tab\nSimilar to the \"Items\" tab, the \"Mobs\" tab will also show mobs in a grid. The mobs are visually rendered on the GUI screen, so it is easier for you to find the mob you are looking for, and because it looks nicer. Just like with the items tab, to see the statistics for a given mob, place your cursor over the said mob, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard. A tooltip text will show you the statistics.  \n  \n*Note that due to technical limitations in my programming, some mobs may fail to render properly, and some mobs may even appear as \"plain text\" instead of their 3D model due to errors in my rendering method.*  \n  \n![Mob statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd6c360face8ba7fcf05224a08044614c7eb9496.png)\n\n### The \"Food & drinks\" statistics tab (formerly \"A balanced diet\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"A balanced died\" advancement. It does that by displaying all food items in grouped grids, similarly to how the \"Items\" tab does it. This tab will show you all food items, even the ones you haven't interacted with, and will also highlight the foods you already ate before, helping you identify which foods you need to eat next to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that this tab may not precisely tell you exactly which foods you do and do not need, as that kind of criteria is controlled \"server-side\", and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all foods are shown instead.*  \n\n![Food & drinks statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/9e3478d0573276349e9842337de3cf598dcf75db.png)\n\n### The \"Hostile creatures\" statistics tab (formerly \"Monsters Hunted\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"Monsters hunted\" advancement. It shows you a grid of mobs similarly to the \"Mobs\" tab, except the mobs shown on this tab are hostile creatures you have either killed or are yet to kill. Similarly to the \"Food & drinks\" tab, any mobs you have killed will be highlighted in this tab, helping you easily see which mobs you need to kill next in order to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that just like with \"Food & drinks\", the criteria for getting the advancement is controlled server-side, and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all hostile creatures are always shown.*  \n\n![Hostile creatures statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fe98cfce86319282774228f4f4c81748eaa00139.png)\n\n### In-game config menu\nA menu that lets you configure the mod in-game. Nothing more or less.  \n\n![In-game config menu](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/7413856bcf4e799b7e265bcf732f17cbb1e2e7c2.png)\n\n### MCBS files\nThis is an additional feature that aims to let people save a \"snapshot\" of their current statistics, into a file, which can then be opened later or shared with other players.  \n  \n*Note that opening an MCBS file does not \"override\" you current stats, as it only shows you what your stats looked like at the time you saved the MCBS file.*\n\n![Saving a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/315ca6da7dcb943b3435c6a11917393786ae4367.png)\n![Opening a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5f1855efceb8870339456bb1d3e8235d795f3cfe.png)\n\n### The statistics hud\nThis is another additional feature that allows you to \"pin\" any stat to the \"in-game-hud\", where you can then look at any statistic of your choosing as you play the game. To pin a stat, simply right-click it with your mouse (hold down shift as well if you have REI installed).  \n\n*Note that due to technical limitations, pinned statistics update occasionally by default, and will not update \"live\" unless this mod is installed on the server-side as well and the \"live stat updates\" is enabled on the client-side.*  \n\n![Pinning stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/3c7e15962f4c8a2268bc5da9a2e7d97ae7850fb6.png)\n![Configuring pinned stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/681f25b72304d0fdde71ab3104d51fab506c3c34.png)\n![What pinned stats look like during gameplay](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd7f29e99ed6b73981b2e2cbcdb4eddb93a2bbcb.png)\n\n## Some QnA\n- What about Minecraft Forge?\n    - I have no plans on making future ports to Forge or any other mod loaders. See [GitHub Issue #100](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/issues/100) for more info. However, not all hope is lost! [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/u58R1TMW) is a mod that lets people run Fabric mods on Forge! Please check it out. Also keep in mind the mod is in beta (as of me writing this), so please don't be harsh towards the mod's developers while expecting the mod to work 100% of the time.\n- Port to older Minecraft versions?\n    - Nope. Same reason as the 'Minecraft Forge' one.\n- I can't pin stats to the hud. I right-click them, but REI shows up instead. How do I pin stats?\n    - Hold down the left shift button while right clicking a stat. That is, if you have REI installed.\n\n## Credits\nThank you to everyone who contributed to the project and helped translate the mod to other languages! And a special thank **you**, the person reading this, for choosing to use this mod! (Well, thank you even if you're just checking out the mod and not actually using it. That also means a lot!)\n\n### The showcase YouTube video I recorded\nI decided to test the mod as well as take screenshots and video footage of the mod in my survival world from the [Better Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) mod pack, so as to show how this mod works and that it works with modded features as well. The screenshots and the video footage also feature the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) being used alongside [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), as well as the [BYG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go) mod.\n\n### The screenshots I took\nResource packs and shader packs used at the time of screenshotting.\n- [Complementary shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/)\n- [3D Default](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/5aPp18Lx)\n- [3D crops Revamped](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/PgpTtNoI)\n- [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/6SLU7tS5)\n\nSorry if I missed any. I had too many of them applied at once.","published":"2022-09-02T19:38:08.030776Z","updated":"2024-05-17T13:28:42.097009Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1330193,"followers":1380,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w13a","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["EnelgdHp","Fk8W9xAv","8RhZhQYw","94aapoJA","4rdXgAx2","uLo8KWrK","SoYOLyoj","WEev32xa","fvo5X8Xj","9eNc6jlA","SAGXYRQW","qgsvDAFG","gz1quzFI","1dR0gD57","307623Pb","F7rjMuqu","WajeE658","H4ve3iC9","oKip6o69","fbwYDHTx","PuyUL15E","wcdeU0Uk","c02NBGoz","YwgivtRx","aMHvwPf2","W7pDuGqC","E1EeTCzR","OFa15O41","QNNqgAdx","nJhfzkvB","GH2n9Xmp","z12xxYRe","823VmOAv","Ufs79Xwx","AKglt1TW","NwsPvqFn","JCedcydw","ytM62cvx","M5IJOqMW","s8PMW1n2","HMC7jXEQ","RM7Dy7vu","9PPcvO4i","UrwGLSJI","LBO8kIEp","DA4J8QTI","zuI0rtcT","oCC1YLFI","5rMFdCwJ","tGhUGisK","sb3SaBaE","QZwSwiZR","18RwTRug","vsM2NrtL","jRrE1yaP","fVJ0IIJU","yebgi9T4","w3dUagqG","8Yswy53a","h7aGFS6n","A6kv9M3f","ng46cYL0","SbiaYJpr","ODcKksFu","cTVirG90","APEn5ML0","eGcQh6sR","VXZAyG4G","dx8kubiy","OQQwqPed","77XYVAe5","5bD14l3I","pQEGz8q4","JwLjCwiB","9Nle6p3Y","XWYy9iPd","saxPMWUK","WNvtlvrR","UPxGVo2j","HZMdcy1s","flzNW6MC","rTAZet3B","S8zvr548","Ah2PN5Vd","TcpdjZq3","TJVb61wk","IRAj3Zja","rCdw3Yao","RanY7iKp","I0YaiUKC","5RoB9ulm","itZVnHEf","yLNRroby","LiBg6GMi","3Dz7ZYBA","WLBCUkWu","uxQfDyI7","UivJDox9","e3q6lD9z","zrhRDvws","rGCv0cOY","qZJRvw7w","1weQYuP0","LyAkMd7b","CdN82lOX","qGf3pduz","KOUA7KHm","E5zqzlew","hsjPjr1l","eZ6vxjVH","CTYD1jrY","hsA6tx3U","2d67uRLI","lwRehylW","9mc9uiOb","PoHesack","qdiBvpLD","cxqQA00g","nRGVPeao","sogTh4cI","cJbr3hAU","KWuKt0ct","1LjgPqG5","71Ie3Fad","25Kl4Bo0","RP77Jp7s","bGYkCuJ4","v5KSPfZS","j9GJlHWA","wyQ2nH56","tEseitwF","N1acUGhP","u3oGwdmM","u5ABQXZg","vnJYWJ44","4lGy0aaq","LsbNVGUA","7E0ghj2a","NNrDcObC","7KRgzNWt","vrAjuu6V","fA72myNS","RLXEmLF9","geaZKRmc","HyPBt1Fe","dqzzU5Hg","p5Xw2LiZ","hZs482mC","6g4qy5hA","L2ERNR7d","11foeqox","Njd7x8bl","5Ci8FUbU","W6ptfTp3","YlLOkKf9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"L2ERNR7d","project_id":"n6PXGAoM","author_id":"j0Ha6a2h","featured":false,"name":"BSS (fabric-1.20.1) - v3.9.7","version_number":"3.9.7+fabric-1.20.1","changelog":"- Resolved [Issue #102](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/issues/102), where `Fabric API` was forcing clients to install this mod.\n    - Turns out the reason for this was due to a flaw in the code on my end, and had nothing to do with `Fabric API`.

[Curseforge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/debugify) • [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/debugify) • [Patched bug list](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/blob/1.19/PATCHED.md) • [Discord](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?\nDebugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n- [**isXander**](https://github.com/isXander) -

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-04-29T20:44:11.845709Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6583996,"followers":9371,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.11.2","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.11.2","changelog":"Lithium 0.11.2 for Minecraft 1.20.1 is the same as the previous release, just for 1.20.1 instead of 1.20.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.1-0.11.2/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T23:58:59.682048Z","downloads":2665680,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d1b5c90ba8b4879814df7fbf6e67412febbb2870e8131858c211130e9b5546e86b213b768b912fc7a2efa37831ad91caf28d6d71ba972274618ffd59937e5d0d","sha1":"8f4642147e60827f728badac7a819d1a9f3b25d5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/ZSNsJrPI/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":645865,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":"2No2Name","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TEZXhE2U/f4705a5f2388c65029ae2e59f1434b3e6e4de23a.png","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar"},"shaderpacks\\ComplementaryReimagined_r5.1.1.zip":{"sha512":"fb6fda4dfc4851bed754f4f0eddac8f065e69e564cbd7c479963b98c95cb5646d1c527ca0f680bde0fd302d0f3f0eaa66be7526ee5df6bdd9df0379b0b1d8cd5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"HVnmMxH1","slug":"complementary-reimagined","project_type":"shader","team":"cZyqwaNw","title":"Complementary Shaders - Reimagined","description":"Preserving the elements of Minecraft with exceptional quality, detail, and performance.","body":"<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q897tXWMccM\" title=\"Reimagine Minecraft | Complementary Reimagined Reveal Trailer\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n### About\nComplementary Shaders is a shader pack for Minecraft Java Edition with exceptional attention to detail, high standards of quality, and top tier optimisation. It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

It makes use of modern 3D graphical APIs and technologies to provide real-time rendering with high performance. For good measure, Modern UI improves and optimizes a set of features used by Google Android and its own set of internationalization supporting text engine.\n\nModern UI for Minecraft, is a Minecraft Mod that is based on Modern UI Core Framework and Modern UI Core Extensions. It provides Modern UI bootstrap program in Minecraft environment and Modding API based on Forge/Fabric, to make powerful Graphical User Interface in Minecraft.\n\nFor client, press Ctrl+K or ⌘+K (by default) to open Action Center screen to configure Modern UI. (Note that you can swipe the Preferences screen to configure fonts)\n\nThis Mod also includes a powerful text layout engine and text rendering system designed for Minecraft.\nThis engine provides appropriate methods for processing Unicode text and gives you more readable text in any scale, in 2D/3D. In details:\n* Real-time preview and reload TrueType/OpenType fonts\n* A better font fallback implementation\n* Anti-aliasing text and FreeType font hinting\n* Use improved SDF text rendering in 2D/3D (also use batch rendering)\n* Compute exact font size in device space for native glyph rendering\n* Use Google Noto Color Emoji and support all the Unicode 15.1 Emoji (September 12, 2023)\n* Configurable bidirectional text heuristic algorithm\n* Configurable text shadow and raw font size\n* Unicode line breaking and CSS line-break & word-break\n* Fast, exact and asynchronous Unicode text layout computation\n* Faster and more memory efficient rectangle packing algorithm for glyphs\n* Use real grayscale texture (1 byte-per-pixel, whereas Minecraft is 4 bpp)\n* Compatible with OptiFine, Sodium (Rubidium), Iris (Oculus) and many mods\n* Compatible with Minecraft's JSON font definition (bitmap fonts, TTF fonts)\n\nAdditionally, this Mod provides many utilities which improve game performance and gaming experience. Currently, we have:\n* Changing screen background color\n* Gaussian blur to screen backdrop image\n* Fade-in animation to screen background\n* More window modes: Fullscreen (borderless), Maximized (borderless)\n* Framerate limit and master volume fading on window inactive (out of focus) and minimized\n* Pausing single-player game when Inventory is open\n* Changing GUI scale option to Slider and providing hint text\n* Playing a \"Ding\" sound when Minecraft loads and reaches the Main Menu\n* Enabling smooth scrolling in Vanilla's Selection List and Forge's Scroll Panel\n* Pressing \"C\" to Zoom that is the same as OptiFine\n* Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) and Unicode grapheme/word iterator for all text fields\n* Playing local music, allowing to seek and view spectrum\n* Support Discord/Slack/GitHub/IamCal/JoyPixels emoji shortcodes in Chatting\n* A fancy tooltip style\n  + Choose rounded border or normal border (with shadow effect)\n  + Add title break and control title line spacing\n  + Auto line wrapping and auto vertical scrolling when out of screen\n  + Center the title line, support RTL layout direction\n  + Exactly position the tooltip to pixel grid (smooth movement)\n  + Change background color and border color (with gradient and animation)\n \n\n### Core Features:\n\n* 2D Graphics Library of Multiple Graphics APIs\n* Intermediate Representation and ASTs of Shading Languages\n* Symbolic distance function and vector graphics rendering\n* Image post-processing effects\n* Fast matrix and vector calculation\n* Image format conversion\n* Animation and transition framework\n* Event loop and multi-threading framework\n* Text shaping and complex text layout engine\n* MVVM and lifecycle handling\n* Automatic RTL (right-to-left) UI layout\n* Markdown (CommonMark) rendering support\n \n\n### Modern Text Engine for Minecraft:\n\n* Support color Emoji, use Google Noto Color Emoji 15.1, based on Unicode 15.1 Emoji list;\n* Support Emoji shortcodes in chat, for example :rofl: to rolling on the floor laughing, support Discord and Slack shortcodes;\n* You can use TTF or OTF fonts, configure the font base size, set the baseline shift, and set whether to drop text shadow;\n* Scalable vector graphics, automatic switching resolution level (up to 96px), native (non-synthetic) Bold and Italic rendering;\n* Supports distance field text rendering in 3D world, but sharpens font atlas in 2D GUI; This enhances a former feature:\n  *Render all characters smoothly on any scale (like when you're away from a sign, or a very small text in GUI)\n* Support multilayer text, layout multiple paragraphs together, streaming layout algorithm, and introduce fast layout cache;\n* Support fast digit replacement, high-precision layout and alignment, and smoothly draw fast changing digits (fixed width);\n* Support mip-mapping, anti-aliasing, linear sampling and supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA);\n* Better and more efficient layout of BiDi text paragraphs (e.g. Arabic, Yiddish); Use sharpen font atlases;\n* Configurable BiDi text heuristic algorithm to control text direction more accurately; Support to fix invalid surrogate pairs;\n* Use HarfBuzz text shaping, support combining characters rendering, like Thai, Devanagari, Bengali and Tamil;\n* Support grapheme cluster break, support Unicode line breaking algorithm;\n* Support context-aware and locale-based word break and line break;\n* Support pixelated font rendering, support fixed resolution level, support pixel alignment;\n* Support bitmap replacement, rendering smoothly for fast changing numbers, support emoji rendering;\n* Optimize the layout algorithm, increase your FPS by about 10% when drawing texts in GUI\n* Use grayscale pixels to store texture, reduce GPU memory usage\n* Reduce unnecessary RAM usage and greatly reduce object creation\n\n### Customize Fonts\nPress Ctrl+K or ⌘+K (by default) to open Action Center, go to Preferences, swipe the screen to the second page, and you will see Font settings.\n* Preferred font family is your most wanted one. It can be either an OS font or a TrueType/OpenType font (collection) file.\n* Fallback font families are used when the preferred font family is unavailable.\n\nModern Text Engine:  \nModern UI follows Minecraft's JSON font definition, only glyph provider type 'legacy_unicode' and 'unihex' are ignored. Modern UI font families mentioned above will serve as fallback font families for Minecraft fonts. Default Font Behavior (in Preferences > Text Layout) gives you an option to remove some glyph providers from the Minecraft default font (minecraft:default). To avoid using vanilla ASCII fonts, just set it to Keep Other. Note this option is only valid if you have not turned on Force Unicode Font. If you want to use vanilla Unicode font, just download the OTF version of [GNU Unifont](https://unifoundry.com/unifont/).\n\n### Additional Features for Minecraft:\n\n* Support setting window mode, such as fullscreen borderless, windowed borderless;\n* GUI screen background fade-in animation and 2-pass gaussian convolution blur effect, configurable background gradient color;\n* Smooth rounded tooltip style, support RTL layout, configurable background and border color;\n* Play a \"ding\" sound effect when the game is loaded;\n* Support pausing the game when your inventory is opened;\n* New GUI scale algorithm and slider GUI scale widget (not limited to even numbers, compatible with OptiFine);\n* Add smooth scrolling for vanilla and forge scrolling panels;\n* Async network handler; Server auto-shutdown;\n* All features are configurable in configs or Action Center screen (default shortkey Ctrl+K)\n\n### Modern UI for Fabric removed some features (compared to the Forge version):\n* OptiFine-like zoom, hide crosshairs in GUI\n* Dump more debugging information, crash report extension\n \n### Comparison with Caxton text rendering techniques\n[Caxton](https://modrinth.com/mod/caxton) mod is known for its MSDF text rendering, you can choose between Caxton and Modern Text Engine.   \n\nSimilarities:\n* Both use HarfBuzz text shaping\n* Both support Unicode text processing\n* Both support Unicode line breaking and grapheme cluster break\n* Both compatible with Iris in raster rendering mode\n* Both have an efficient rectangle packing algorithm, further better than Mojang's\n\nDifferences:\n* Caxton uses a newer HarfBuzz whereas we use a older one (bundled with JDK 17, it's updated in JDK 21)\n* Caxton uses multi-channel SDF and renders sharper scaling-up texts, whereas we render over-rounded\n* We are compatible with OptiFine, whereas Caxton isn't\n* We support color emoji, whereas Caxton doesn't\n* We support FreeType font hinting whereas Caxton never support it, font hinting helps on low-res monitor\n* We support perfect sampling of native glyph image in screen-space, this is ideal for 2D rendering\n* We support single-channel SDF text rendering without additional GPU resources, we always use 1bpp textures\n* We have smart SDF sampling method for scaling-down texts, whereas Caxton hasn't\n* No need to wait for MSDF texture generation, you can switch fonts in-game with just one click\n* We support various text direction heuristics and line break strategies\n* We don't use additional native libraries, so Modern UI works on macOS\n* We have a slightly higher layout performance than Caxton, and use less RAM\n\n### Mod Integration & Compatibility:\n\n#### Compatible (you should pay attention to):\n\nOptiFine, Sodium, Iris, Create, AoA3  \nIf Shaders are active, *Use Modern Text Shaders in 3D* is auto disabled, it will cause the outline of glowing text to become invisible.\n\n#### Mods with similar functions are replaced:\n\n* Blur (ver 1.15 ~ 1.20; reason: full functional coverage, better optimization)\n  + Blur mod claims to use Gaussian blur, but I found it actually uses 2-pass box blur. Whereas Modern UI gives you the true 1-pass Gaussian Blur, which is better than Blur mod.\n* Controlling (ver 1.15; reason: another way of implementation)\n* TipTheScales (ver 1.15 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Inventory Pause (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Emojiful (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: we support color emoji rendering since 3.5.0; additionally, Emojiful has really bad code and breaks your game everywhere; you may experience game freezing, high VRAM usage, rendering glitches, and many performance & mod compatibility issues)\n* Borderless Window (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Ding (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* SmoothScrollingEverywhere (ver 1.18 ~ 1.19; reason: another way of implementation)\n* FPS Reducer (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n\n\n#### Conflict and Solution:\n\n* Emojiful (ver 1.16 ~ 1.20; it's not recommended to use Emojiful; if you must use it,  disable Modern UI text engine, via config screen or bootstrap properties)\n* Legendary Tooltips (ver 1.16 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI tooltip, via config screen)\n* FeyTweaks (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable TextRendererMixin in FeyTweaks' mixin config)\n* SmoothScrollingEverywhere (ver 1.18 ~ 1.19; solution: disable Modern UI smooth scrolling, via config screen)\n* Caxton (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI text engine, via config screen or bootstrap properties)\n* ImmediatelyFast (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable ImmediatelyFast's hud_batching, font_atlas_resizing and fast_text_lookup; otherwise, you may experience random game crashes)\n* Untranslated Items (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI text component cache, via config screen)\n\n#### Supported MC versions:\n* Actively maintained: 1.20.4, 1.20.1, 1.19.4, 1.19.2\n* About to be dropped: 1.20.2, 1.20, 1.18.2, 1.18.1\n* No longer supported: 1.18, 1.17.1, 1.16.5, 1.16.4, 1.16.3, 1.16.2, 1.16.1, 1.15.2, 1.14.4\n\nAll descriptions on this page are for Minecraft 1.19.4 and above. Some features may be missing in older versions.\n\n#### PC Requirements (same as Minecraft Vanilla)\nSome people are unwilling to use Modern UI because they believe that Modern UI has a high PC requirements. In fact, as long as you can play Minecraft Vanilla, you can definitely play Modern UI. Unless you forget to update your GPU driver.\n* OS: Windows 8.1+, Linux with X11 or Wayland, macOS\n* Architecture: x64 or arm64\n* GPU: GeForce 210 or better\n* GPU Driver: OpenGL 3.3+ or Vulkan 1.1+, higher is better\n* Java: Java 17+, higher is better\n\n\n### FAQ:\n\n##### Q: What is the difference between Default Font Behavior and Force Unicode Font?\nA: Firstly, Modern UI always redirects Unicode font to Modern UI default typeface. Default Font Behavior is KEEP ALL in 1.19+, then Minecraft default font is used for ASCII characters. KEEP OTHER means that Minecraft default font is no longer used, but additional fonts, for example, in some minigame maps, are still available. This is the difference from Force Unicode Font (IGNORE ALL).\n\n##### Q: Does Modern UI have a high overhead? Will Modern UI lower application performance?\nA: No, Modern UI does not have a significant impact on CPU, GPU, RAM, and VRAM usage. This is because Modern UI itself has good optimization, but at the same time, Modern UI provides a bunch of new features and effects. Modern UI framework is known to be more efficient than Chromium-based applications.\nFor low-end PCs, screen blur effect may be a performance killer, because Minecraft Vanilla does not allow mipmap generation on render targets. Even so, the blur effect provided by Modern UI is much faster than a mod called 'Blur'.\n\n##### Q: How to disable all changes to vanilla, I don't want these features.\nA: Only GUI scale algorithm and some low-level code are non-configurable, any other features can be disabled in Action Center screen (shortkey Ctrl+K by default), or config files (gameDir/config/ModernUI/), because Modern UI is essentially a framework.\n\n##### Q: Is this mod a client-only mod? Do I need to install it on the server?\nA: Since MC 1.19.2, there is no reason to install this mod on the server anymore. All server features are deprecated and implemented to Forge API and Fabric API.\n\n##### Q: How to get start to develop my mod based on Modern UI?\nA: This project is still in early stages, the specification is still being written. You can view the [JavaDoc](https://blocamlimb.github.io/ModernUI/javadoc/). Examples include Modern UI itself (Action Center) and Flux Networks.

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2024-05-26T19:08:53.744849Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1286641,"followers":1027,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff","AHxQGtuC","7aQD4OG8","SGjPO8H9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"AHxQGtuC","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.7.2","version_number":"3.7.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-11T04:25:11.224830Z","downloads":199640,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d58cc8759587f03f320f188972ca66baa788d008","sha512":"bedf97c87c5e556416410267108ad358b32806448be24ef8ae1a79ac63b78b48b9c851c00c845b8aedfc7805601385420716b9e65326fdab21340e8ba3cc4274"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/AHxQGtuC/trinkets-3.7.2.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar","primary":true,"size":238532,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":"Emi","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar"},"mods\\geckolib-fabric-1.20.1-4.4.5.jar":{"sha512":"1fb3670c6779a34c307d0338b1b108ca95fbc3fa46ad2cb42dd8dd9aa03f0392505f49f3a5de04c921c4bd29aab35f742978a1ee5911f4b9a777ba85be68302d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8BmcQJ2H","slug":"geckolib","project_type":"mod","team":"XGT1SohE","title":"Geckolib","description":"A 3D animation library for entities, blocks, items, armor, and more!","body":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/nQsXG5b/Geckolib-Banner.jpg\" alt=\"logo\"/> \n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/pPEqBgJtZW\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/730912704776110121?color=green&label=Discord&logo=Discord&logoColor=green&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"discord\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/geckosmods\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=geckosmods&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&color=green&logoColor=green\" alt=\"patreon\"/> </a>\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:10vw\">GeckoLib is an animation engine for Minecraft Mods, with support for complex 3D keyframe-based animations, 30+ easings, concurrent animation support, sound and particle keyframes, event keyframes, and more.

mod to optimize the Minecraft networking stack","body":"## Warning\n\n**Krypton is a work-in-progress.** I do not provide any guarantees about its stability, compatibility with other mods, or support for every possible setup out there. Support for this mod is provided on a \"best-effort\" basis. This is not my day job, it is a hobby growing out of related work I've done.\n\n## Sponsor Me!\n\nDid this mod make your server playable? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium. Support beyond these mods is provided on a best effort basis.","published":"2020-12-21T17:48:09.050177Z","updated":"2024-04-30T05:33:44.554246Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2913845,"followers":2847,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["tO4HJpLA","19624YsD","7AwqDL7J","Ff90AgU6","PGovBIXq","AXYWaIE8","kCiWZ1wv","QmrcLtH3","vJQ7plH2","UJ6FlFnK","vx0mZa04","Tncui9tU","jiDwS0W1","cQ60Ouax","X2k7QAQS","bRcuOnao","PYi5mm1G"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"jiDwS0W1","project_id":"fQEb0iXm","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.2.3","version_number":"0.2.3","changelog":"* Updated to Minecraft 1.20\n* Removed a mixin that is now implemented in the base game\n* Improved protocol conformance - Krypton now handles servers dynamically disabling and re-enabling compression\n* Added events indicating when certain events in the network pipeline happen that mods can snoop on\n  * As a consequence of this, the old ViaFabric hooks have been removed.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-10T03:25:18.657621Z","downloads":1640262,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4d499819effd8afe811e5d93952fcc46765a00df","sha512":"92b73a70737cfc1daebca211bd1525de7684b554be392714ee29cbd558f2a27a8bdda22accbe9176d6e531d74f9bf77798c28c3e8559c970f607422b6038bc9e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/versions/jiDwS0W1/krypton-0.2.3.jar","filename":"krypton-0.2.3.jar","primary":true,"size":185895,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LBcJZJkm","user":{"id":"y0WF9UR5","username":"astei","name":"Andrew Steinborn","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16436212?v=4","bio":"Sometime Minecraft modder, currently an software engineer at the fintech startup Ramp","created":"2020-12-21T14:36:31.896442Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"krypton-0.2.3.jar"},"mods\\variantsandventures-mc1.20.1-1.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"75d490f13768ca3ceb485a9a5ebddca734677a21229a8a8dcaf11b0095ac1f708ac7d5e0247692ce61b116f313783dadd92062adc0c359ffc851a541c8bcb2ab","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lNDRiXkY","slug":"variants-and-ventures","project_type":"mod","team":"kiNqPGAl","title":"Variants & Ventures","description":"Adds multiple new mob variants seamlessly integrated into your Minecraft world.","body":"<br>\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t<img title=\"Variants & Ventures\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Faboslav/variants-and-ventures/master/.github/assets/logo.png\" alt=\"Variants ý Ventures\" width=\"743\" height=\"69\">\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t<a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://ko-fi.com/faboslav\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Support me on&message=Ko-fi&color=5b9c51&labelColor=5b9c51&logoColor=ffffff&style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi\" alt=\"Ko-fi\">\n\t</a>\n\t<a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Faboslav\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?color=5b9c51&label=Support me on&labelColor=5b9c51&logoColor=ffffff&url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=Faboslav&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"Patreon\">\n\t</a>\n\t<a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://discord.gg/QGwFvvMQCn\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/924964658169913404?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&label=Community&labelColor=5b9c51&color=5b9c51\" alt=\"Discord\">\n\t</a>\n\t<a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://github.com/Faboslav/variants-and-ventures/wiki\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Wiki&logoColor=ffffff&style=for-the-badge&logo=github&labelColor=5b9c51&color=5b9c51\" alt=\"Wiki\">\n\t</a>\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">\n\tVariants & Ventures adds multiple new mob variants seamlessly integrated into your Minecraft world.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">\n\tYou can check <a title=\"wiki\" href=\"https://github.com/Faboslav/variants-and-ventures/wiki\">wiki</a> for a detailed overview of implemented mobs and features.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<h1>Gelid (Frozen Zombie)</h1>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">\n\t<a href=\"https://github.com/Faboslav/variants-and-ventures/wiki/Gelid\">Gelid</a> is a new zombie variant that inflicts freezing when it attacks.

(but not really)™ for Blay's multiplatform mods. This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

Block Entities","description":"Reduce FPS lag with block entities, as well as customize them with resource packs","body":"## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With

In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB.

So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-05-01T06:08:18.836384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":5630708,"followers":5135,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:39:15.937801Z","downloads":1593975,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457","sha1":"8fa3b84fc5860dbc30fdf8cced02af68dffcf3fa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/unerR5MN/ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125197,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\EnchantmentDescriptions-Fabric-1.20.1-17.0.15.jar":{"sha512":"211ff9adb7cd6a93c862a7d266cde3b85a92e76b4b80abf36deabda1d11b076e08d045b66363360f169f8b4edbc5fa5b20746f8a00bc2e513664979116299041","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"UVtY3ZAC","slug":"enchantment-descriptions","project_type":"mod","team":"jJHDf5Y8","title":"Enchantment Descriptions","description":"Provides a way to get enchantment descriptions from enchanted books.","body":"# Enchantment Descriptions\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Enchantment Descriptions is a light weight client-side mod that adds descriptions of enchantments to the tool tip of enchanted books.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>. An&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">automatic skull-shaped waypoint</strong>&nbsp;is created&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">on each death</strong>. Old deathpoints are converted to regular waypoints, which you can disable using the \"Keep Old Deathpoints\" setting.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">chunk grid</strong>. The chunk grid shows you where block chunks begin and end.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">slime chunks</strong>&nbsp;mode. The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the <em>Waypoints Menu (press U) -&gt; Options</em> screen.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mobs</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">yellow dots.</strong>&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Hostile and friendly</strong>&nbsp;mobs can be colored&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">differently. </strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">players</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">white dots or player heads.&nbsp;</strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">items</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">red dots. </strong>Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays all the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">other entities</strong>&nbsp;such as arrows and item frames as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">purple dots</strong><span class=\"bbc\">.</span><strong class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;</strong>Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Options for <strong>displaying entity names </strong>on the minimap<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.</li>\n<li>Zoom in and out key bindings&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">(I and O by default) </strong>to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Coordinates&nbsp;</strong>under the minimap.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Current biome name</strong>&nbsp;under the minimap.

You can choose between the 12 hour and the 24 hour formats.</li>\n<li><strong>Current camera angles</strong> under the minimap. Disabled by default.</li>\n<li>Setting to hide/unhide all waypoint coordinates from all UI screens.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

regions</li>\n<li>Dimension &amp; biome blacklisting</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Beautiful Custom Dimension Titles \n\n<p>\nTry out the beautiful <a title=\"Visual Traveler's Titles\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/visual-travelers-titles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visual Traveler's Titles</a> resource pack add-on by UnRoman for completely custom dimension titles! It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:26:24.670551Z","updated":"2024-05-10T01:54:07.393811Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":550469,"followers":693,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["nIfqKsvT","yLYslqqw","8j6rQRir","U7s0a0fP","olf32JwT","yOjVCeqk","ZA3ahpCR","xcHI86YI","oUSK4sOQ","MbifZGB0","TTAtymNe","zbwk2CBy","vsCE3dyt","yMVTlUDY","Hyc60sDr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/5f218490f1edb9c55fd18e05f52247727117b93f.png"},"version":{"id":"MbifZGB0","project_id":"JtifUr64","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.2 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.20-Fabric-4.0.2","changelog":"- Added support for the following mods: Mine Cells, Eden Ring, Deeper Darker, Aether, The True Backrooms, VoidZ, Atlantis.  \n- Added partial Chinese and Japanese translations.  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-28T20:30:11.867199Z","downloads":78414,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9698f7347b3c98276e4d4035e731e34e926e82d0","sha512":"a8af88107664482f907e5e797156f677e79f96009b834a77f38c184cc651b88db5adac2f4edd8c6945a199157eedd9a366774f7a52458e8286fdbb492d4d8787"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/versions/MbifZGB0/TravelersTitles-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar","filename":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":345764,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"cn94wA70","user":{"id":"f74fCorY","username":"Drullkus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5010174?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-12T01:48:09.113754Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"cn94wA70","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar"},"mods\\autotag-2.0.2+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"86b27da622ca4d5003e2c78c9da91468fde31e6d57af92e3f346403935818b6b1f02f16114ff11fc635a2f6b7511003c37141fb947d9d8537805b7deff2bbd5d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8FdYDHF5","slug":"autotag","project_type":"mod","team":"CuOWTsQ5","title":"AutoTag","description":"Automatically populates some item, block and other tags (for mod compatibility)","body":"This is a purely technical mod with the aim to increase inter-mod compatibility. By \"purely technical\" I mean that it won't add any content to your game.\n\n### The Problem\n\nMod creators are encouraged to use tags where possible, e.g. when creating a recipe. If mods are supposed to work together though, they should all share a same base of common \"conventional\" tags, which group certain items together. Not all developers add their items to common tags though, which means that a person playing with many mods or a mod pack creator might need to create long lists of all items which fulfill certain criteria to add them to specific tags.\n\n### The Solution\n\nUpon loading a world, this mod will automatically populate some tags based on code conditions, covering all modded content as well.\n\nIt's mostly relevant for mod pack creators who need / want to configure mods by adding to specific tags - this allows them to e.g. easily add all armor items to a tag, because they'll all be bundled in `c:armor`.\n\nAs another example, all items which are equippable in the head slot will land in a tag called `c:head_equippables`:\n\n![Screenshot of the `c:head_equippables` tag](https://i.imgur.com/2E36FZS.png)\n \n\n### Additional Information\n\nFor an overview of the tags the mod currently adds, as well as the blacklist option via datapacks, [view the README on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/blob/1.18/README.md).\n\nIf you have any suggestions for new tags, feel free to post them in the comments or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/issues)!\n\n\n\nI hope this mod helps someone and makes their life a bit easier. :)\n\n----\n\nThe mod icon is a composition of modified icons created by

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-05-27T14:31:00.360011Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4143444,"followers":2454,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc","DretS191","WdbHS4uT","elFOHmh9","R7WWpY0Z","G8Aq3OEv","WTCAdLsq","MJUxq3kq","LXUa8bFw","h61Z2iVZ","dLAG06tP","CL7AHQsm","HHrwznjQ","XNQUud9H","rsM9VY0D","bovSU7Mt","EkAJiIZH","lALu7fvN","TD5Fv92S","ePcFYsKB","hf7D9v77","8DXWiiaq","mkXoQQMn","ZHFdxhFP","hCwZI62j","sDwfolBP","G2PcCpZl","3jH5u49m","RXrT2ogA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"RXrT2ogA","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"YetAnotherConfigLib 3.4.4 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"3.4.4+1.20.1-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.4.4\n\nThis build supports the following versions:\n- Fabric 1.20.1\n- Fabric 1.20.4\n- Fabric 1.20.6 (also supports 1.20.5)\n- NeoForge 1.20.6 (also supports 1.20.5)\n- NeoForge 1.20.4\n- MinecraftForge 1.20.1\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix Kotlin DSL not being included\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-27T14:31:01.933962Z","downloads":28679,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"010e9ca808de2172067ea1663cac27472e6dbbc76158e2b6808ee35b4f2b1decc9c4461c633b89d4357e66a2aaecf99c01f8b9c745192506ad06179fb251d672","sha1":"f2bbefc0279d3272fbda979702e8e0371b7ba01d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/versions/RXrT2ogA/YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.4%2B1.20.1-fabric.jar","filename":"YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.4+1.20.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":1072972,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nwpe87D0","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.4+1.20.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\CraftTweaker-fabric-1.20.1-14.0.40.jar":{"sha512":"2f2778b034f885c9a533f8465e55c1a089f65d878ae594ce8ec1cd3a0b5e3527441d89167716aeee109f24f935aff52067ddfd6f34237a82266c87f37d10461c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Xg35A4rS","slug":"crafttweaker","project_type":"mod","team":"eVtU9S5P","title":"CraftTweaker","description":"CraftTweaker allows modpacks and servers to customize the game.

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-02-06T00:32:19.293889Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4887314,"followers":5957,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Aouse6P7","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.30 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.8/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog":"- Also allow 1.20.1 (fixes #277) (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-06T00:32:27.223998Z","downloads":1599536,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b24233f29c0ce4802c61ea8998e01e6e4580ae60","sha512":"3b9c9beef42f72bc75094595c92038c38e36fcde75890c73ced01aed4fb2a8a85cddb8edd2aa91ea6ed2dd41f8afedaa3dbca8f70c716197a7f2ee5b26060562"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/Aouse6P7/indium-1.0.30%2Bmc1.20.4.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":104805,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\nohostilesaroundcampfire-1.20.1-5.9.jar":{"sha512":"3231f253a6744dbc9d91ccf1cee42173b5ecf762f670045de359d2a1ed71e868d9861d9d41e88d8655bf4b4c57cbf5f978758821799989a8c7e1834af9d187f3","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"EJqeyaVz","slug":"no-hostiles-around-campfire","project_type":"mod","team":"J4Se7Kod","title":"No Hostiles Around Campfire","description":"🔥 Prevents hostile mob spawns and burns them around the campfire in a configurable radius.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><center><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/description/header/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"838\" height=\"400\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://curseforge.com/members/serilum/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/curseforge.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/modrinth.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/patreon.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/youtube.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a></center></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Requires the library mod&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:24px\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/collective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collective</a>.</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;This mod is part of <span style=\"color:#008000\"><a style=\"color:#008000\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/the-vanilla-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vanilla Experience</a></span>.</strong><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\">No Hostiles Around Campfire is a configurable mod which prevents hostile mob spawns around the campfire in a configurable radius.

It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

This can be used by mod packs and servers to define custom recipes and other features for a wide range of mods. It can also be used to change textures, override tooltips, and change other aspects of the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Data Packs</h3>\n<p>Data packs are used by Minecraft to load recipes, loot tables, functions, and other game mechanics. Many mods also pull from data packs to handle custom recipe systems and other new mechanics. OpenLoader will load any data packs that are placed in the ~/config/openloader/data folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/data instead. OpenLoader can load zipped and folder packs. You can learn more about data packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Resource Packs</h3>\n<p>Resource packs are used to define textures, translations, sounds, and other client data. You can use them to override existing resources or add completely new ones. These packs are loaded from the ~/config/openloader/resources folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/resources instead. OpenLoader can load zipped or unzipped packs.&nbsp;You can learn more about resource packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>FaQ</h3>\n<p><strong>Does this support mods like Patchouli or BotanyPots?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, packs loaded by this mod will behave exactly like packs loaded through the vanilla systems. So anything that works through the normal resource packs folder or the world datapack folder will work here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My pack is not loading?</strong></p>\n<p>If your pack is not loading it is because you have not followed the instructions properly or have made an invalid pack. Make sure you have the file placed in the right folder and that your pack has a valid pack.mcmeta file. Unfortunately I do not have the time or resources to help you debug your packs, but there are countless resources and communities available to help you make these things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does pack load order work?</strong></p>\n<p>Any resource packs loaded by OpenLoader should be loaded after vanilla and modded resource packs. Data pack load orders are done on a per-world basis instead and can be very annoying. Initially all data packs loaded by this mod will be loaded after vanilla and modded packs. Any mods added to the game after that initial world load will load after all previously loaded packs but only for that world. This can be fixed by using Vanilla's data pack command to correct the world order on a per-world basis. If you need more consistent control over load order I would recommend a scripting tool like <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">CraftTweaker</a> which is more robust and stable than the data pack system.</p>\n\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=forge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=fabric\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabric</a><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-paintings/files/all?filter-status=1&filter-game-version=2020709689:7499\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Features\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\n## 🤔 What does this mod do?\n\nETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!\nThis way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

more easily in Minecraft. To be clear, this mod (technically) does not add any emoji to the game, it only makes typing the ones _already in the game_ easier. For this reason, emoji typed will be visible to anyone else on a server and will still be there (on signs, books, etc) if you uninstall the mod. I can not absolutely guarantee all symbols/emoji will work on all servers, some servers have plugins that mess with chat and there is really nothing I can do about that. **This is a client-side mod. Installing it on a server won't do anything.**\n\n### Typing Emojis\nTo type an emoji in chat, simply type a \":\" (colon), after that a list of all possible emoji keywords will appear. Once you type a keyword it will be replaced with the corresponding emoji or symbol.

It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can report issues on [Here](https://kubejs.com/support?source=kubejs).\n\n## I have more questions/suggestions!\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord

More information can be found [here](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop#configuring-chop-counting-version-0130-and-later)._\n\n| Tree blocks |  Chops required |\n| ------------ | ---------------- |\n| 1  | 1 |\n| 3 | 3 |\n| 5 | 4 |\n| 10 | 7 |\n| 20 | 12 |\n| 50 | 19 |\n|100 | 25 |\n\n<details><summary>Compatibility:</summary>\n\n#### Special support for the following mods:\n- (1.18.2) [Tinker's Construct](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkers-construct): broad axes perform extra chops. All axes perform more chops with \"expanded\" upgrades.\n- (1.18.2+) Silent Gear: saws perform extra chops\n- (1.18.2+) [Project MMO](https://modrinth.com/mod/project-mmo): chopping grants woodcutting XP\n- (1.18.2+) [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade), [WTHIT](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit), [TheOneProbe](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-one-probe): show number of log blocks in trees and the number of chops needed to fell.\n\n#### Known issues:\n- (1.18.2 and earlier) Multi Mine: choppable blocks need to be added to Multi Mine's blacklist. This should be fixed for 1.19+ versions. See [#106](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/106).\n- Some modded trees leave floating blocks when felled. See [#44](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/44).\n\n_Want to make your mod compatible with TreeChop?

How do I turn off chopping?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"chopping\" setting. A key can also be bound to toggle chopping without opening the settings screen; go to Options > Controls and find the section labeled \"HT's TreeChop\".\n\n#### 2. How do I keep chopping off and only turn it on while sneaking?\nBy default, sneaking inverts your current chop setting, so just toggle chopping off (press n to access the settings screen) so that chopping will be enabled by sneaking.\n\n#### 3. How do I keep chopping even when sneaking?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"Sneaking inverts chopping\" setting.\n\n#### 4. How do I keep from chopping my house down?\nThere's a setting to disable chopping if the \"tree\" is not connected to leaves. Press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle \"trees must have leaves\".\n\n#### 5. I started chopping my house down. How do I stop?\nIf you find yourself chopping a block when you just wanted to break it normally, try breaking the block while sneaking, or toggle off chopping (press n to access the settings screen).\n\n#### 6. I was chopping something and the game crashed! What's up with that?\nProbably the item you used to chop the tree doesn't play nice with TreeChop. Go to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and add the item's registry name to choppingToolsBlacklist, or ask the server owner to, and then maybe let me know about the conflict and I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 7. Why can't I chop anymore?\nMaybe chopping is turned off; press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle on the \"chopping\" setting. If chopping is enabled and changing tools doesn't help, then there might be a conflict with another mod. If you send me a recent log, I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 8. Why do some trees leave behind floating leaves when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and its leaves are not set up properly. Let me know what type of tree is misbehaving, and I'll politely inform the mod owners.\nb) there are too many leaves! You can increase the max number of leaves by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxLeavesBlocks.\n\n#### 9. Why do some trees leave behind floating logs when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and is weirdly shaped. Let me know, and I'll try to make TreeChop do a better job of detecting that type of tree.\nb) the tree is too big! You can increase the max tree size by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxTreeBlocks.\n\n#### 10. How do I disable mushroom and fungus chopping?\nGo to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and change\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables\"\nto\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables_except_mushrooms\"\nIf you want more control over which blocks can be chopped, you have to make your own datapack and fiddle with the block tags (see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag for more info).\n\n#### 12. Why am I not seeing the [fill in the blank] feature?\nOnly the newest version of Minecraft 1.16 is fully supported. Some older versions, especially 1.12.2, lack some of the fancier features.\n\n#### 11. Can I include this in a modpack?\nYes!\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Sample configs:</summary>\n\n<details><summary>treechop-common.toml</summary>\n\n```toml\n[permissions]\n\n\t[permissions.choppingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.fellingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.sneakBehavior]\n\t\tcanBeNone = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertFelling = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertChopping = true\n\n\t[permissions.treeMustHaveLeaves]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.chopInCreativeMode]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n[general]\n\t#If false, log items will be destroyed when chopping\n\tdropLootForChoppedBlocks = true\n\n[treeDetection]\n\t#Maximum number of log blocks that can be detected to belong to one tree\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxTreeBlocks = 320\n\t#Maximum number of leaves blocks that can destroyed when a tree is felled\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxLeavesBlocks = 1024\n\t#Destroy leaves when a tree is felled\n\tbreakLeaves = true\n\t#Non-decayable leaves are ignored when detecting leaves\n\tignorePersistentLeaves = true\n\t#Maximum distance from log blocks to destroy non-standard leaves blocks (e.g. mushroom caps) when felling\n\t#Range: 0 ~ 16\n\tmaxBreakLeavesDistance = 7\n\n\t[treeDetection.logs]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered choppable\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:choppables\", \"#minecraft:logs\", \"#forge:mushroom_stems\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be chopped, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = [\"minecraft:bamboo\"]\n\n\t[treeDetection.leaves]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered leaves\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:leaves_like\", \"#minecraft:leaves\", \"#minecraft:wart_blocks\", \"#forge:mushroom_caps\", \"minecraft:shroomlight\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be considered leaves, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = []\n\n[chopCounting]\n\t#Method to use for computing the number of chops needed to fell a tree\n\t#Allowed Values: LINEAR, LOGARITHMIC\n\talgorithm = \"LOGARITHMIC\"\n\t#How to round the number of chops needed to fell a tree;

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: Why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features).\n</details>\n\n----------\n\n![ToS](https://imgur.com/zqDp5zR.png)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Terms of Use:</summary>  \n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n**Fresh Animations: Terms & Conditions**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n- By using this resource pack, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions\n- FreshLX is the creator and copyright owner of this resource pack\n- These terms are subject to change at any time\n- These terms only apply if you intend to use the resource pack in your own content you want to share publicly\n- The terms listed on the official project CurseForge, Modrinth, and Planet Minecraft pages, supersede any license, readme or terms/conditions information provided anywhere else, including in the resource pack files\n- Not all the assets/elements of this resource pack are subject to these terms.

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling.

included via Jar-in-Jar to allow it to be removed from `fabric.mod.json`, which was causing issues in developement environments when Night Config wasn't retrieved from the official Maven, but instead production jars were used, e.g. from the Curse Maven\n- Note that Night Config is shaded without being relocated to a different package, which is necessary to stay consistent with Forge\n###

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3155516,"followers":3583,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.
