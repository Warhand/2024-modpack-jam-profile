[Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium. Support beyond these mods is provided on a best effort basis.","published":"2020-12-21T17:48:09.050177Z","updated":"2024-04-30T05:33:44.554246Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2740934,"followers":2828,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["tO4HJpLA","19624YsD","7AwqDL7J","Ff90AgU6","PGovBIXq","AXYWaIE8","kCiWZ1wv","QmrcLtH3","vJQ7plH2","UJ6FlFnK","vx0mZa04","Tncui9tU","jiDwS0W1","cQ60Ouax","X2k7QAQS","bRcuOnao","PYi5mm1G"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"bRcuOnao","project_id":"fQEb0iXm","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"Krypton 0.2.6","version_number":"0.2.6","changelog":"* Fixes a memory leak.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-02T01:58:52.570969Z","downloads":292629,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a3e4eadcd8074a0a68a1378c90824b58199bedbab2f7eaa3961db9b10b99215805dde4eb73be5ec3118f38fbb0beaa8a1b6f9de6966a741d32dbf181a44ae11b","sha1":"fc237a3cdf7cff71e222db8e14fa6d4546e2d000"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/versions/bRcuOnao/krypton-0.2.6.jar","filename":"krypton-0.2.6.jar","primary":true,"size":167163,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LBcJZJkm","user":{"id":"y0WF9UR5","username":"astei","name":"Andrew Steinborn","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16436212?v=4","bio":"Sometime Minecraft modder, currently an software engineer at the fintech startup Ramp","created":"2020-12-21T14:36:31.896442Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"krypton-0.2.6.jar"},"mods\\betterbeds-1.3.0-1.19.3.jar":{"sha512":"47c9237393b83c5eee2c82b48fefc82bf4ff932161e78fac0318f52cfc33615b19a0a7e5cacfecf2ef35d603da5af9c69bdaf365db4de1eb1aa90aae647d18f7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kKwy3HU9","slug":"better-beds","project_type":"mod","team":"1tkprR2K","title":"Better Beds","description":"Changes the renderer of the bed to use json models instead of a block entity renderer!

(This means they will lose their lid opening animation! Check out [Enhanced Block Entities](https://modrinth.com/mod/ebe) if you care about that.)\n\nDepending on how many chests you have around, you'll see varying effectiveness. In large storage rooms this mod can easily double your FPS, but keep in mind that chests aren't the only thing responsible for bad performance.\n\nFastChest works with Sodium and Optifine and should be compatible with all other mods and resource packs that leave chests alone. For example, the *Vanilla Tweaks Proper Break Particles* resource pack doesn't. It overwrites the chest blockstate definitions and is not compatible out of the box. You can however delete `chest.json`, `ender_chest.json` and `trapped_chest.json` from the `/assets/minecraft/blockstates` directory of your resource pack to make it work with the mod.\n\nA classic (full-block) chest resource pack can be downloaded from [here](https://up.domi.re/pa1f7rxa).\n","published":"2023-09-23T23:08:38.006171Z","updated":"2023-11-06T11:44:33.258213Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":58376,"followers":88,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["Dk9lpuiC","nyEDcRrB","hNZkXlPh","y0MNfkeB","DjQllHib","1UK7dyZ1","MQXv1FCf","jm8zP5GA","DY9aRIvz","jURzorVi","2pqk3SqY","9TMPN7m0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WNcgffMw/24755b2f991530a2c511f9eb8c93a39da8e3073d.png"},"version":{"id":"9TMPN7m0","project_id":"WNcgffMw","author_id":"Ld1GCkRF","featured":false,"name":"FastChest 1.5+1.20.2","version_number":"1.5+1.20.2","changelog":"Prevent chest client ticks  \nUpdate config screen for 1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-06T11:44:33.873941Z","downloads":13040,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"53cd149ae9e832b75b3f8d965c71696b76b30e334e2cc7965eadfa36a56e713dddfc1c13b67129301da7d864d88b145e6015f95b8e8f784cdd0c1a6fd66fec49","sha1":"29920fb6786f39a5859244d29daeb7e5f4ec3972"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WNcgffMw/versions/9TMPN7m0/fast-chest-1.5%2B1.20.2.jar","filename":"fast-chest-1.5+1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":24770,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"OOMBoK47","user":{"id":"Ld1GCkRF","username":"Domi","name":"Domi","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1492543?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-27T16:58:23.621460Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fast-chest-1.5+1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\pescatore-1.0.0-beta.rel+1.20.4.jar":{"sha512":"074a54007d53842de4b7eb9a642e2771eb5d1203b2105eb2d20e40c8b44cde5cfd5a5387a01d94cd1d738342e88e2a55d6568bd19359215d9964ee0acc31db0f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uxaMjp3X","slug":"pescatore","project_type":"mod","team":"EkceKcDT","title":"Pescatore","description":"Another fishing minigame in Minecraft!","body":"<center>\n  <h3>Pescatore: Un mare di guai</h3>\n  <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/pescatore\"><img alt=\"modrinth\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/available/modrinth_64h.png\" /></a>\n  <a href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pescatore\"><img alt=\"curseforge\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/available/curseforge_64h.png\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/acikek/pescatore\"><img alt=\"github\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/available/github_64h.png\" /></a><br>\n  <a href=\"https://discord.gg/QYymKz84tR\"><img alt=\"discord-plural\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/social/discord-plural_64h.png\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://modfest.net/1.20\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModFest/art/3bf66556e674d670e30f647d6a48c4e1798c21d4/badge/128h/ModFest%201.20%20Badge%20Cozy.png\" width=\"256\" alt=\"ModFest 1.20\"></a>\n</center>\n\n---\n\n**Pescatore** adds a new fishing minigame to Minecraft.

It provides Modern UI bootstrap program in Minecraft environment and Modding API based on Forge/Fabric, to make powerful Graphical User Interface in Minecraft.\n\nFor client, press Ctrl+K or ⌘+K (by default) to open Action Center screen to configure Modern UI. (Note that you can swipe the Preferences screen to configure fonts)\n\nThis Mod also includes a powerful text layout engine and text rendering system designed for Minecraft.\nThis engine provides appropriate methods for processing Unicode text and gives you more readable text in any scale, in 2D/3D. In details:\n* Real-time preview and reload TrueType/OpenType fonts\n* A better font fallback implementation\n* Anti-aliasing text and FreeType font hinting\n* Use improved SDF text rendering in 2D/3D (also use batch rendering)\n* Compute exact font size in device space for native glyph rendering\n* Use Google Noto Color Emoji and support all the Unicode 15.1 Emoji (September 12, 2023)\n* Configurable bidirectional text heuristic algorithm\n* Configurable text shadow and raw font size\n* Unicode line breaking and CSS line-break & word-break\n* Fast, exact and asynchronous Unicode text layout computation\n* Faster and more memory efficient rectangle packing algorithm for glyphs\n* Use real grayscale texture (1 byte-per-pixel, whereas Minecraft is 4 bpp)\n* Compatible with OptiFine, Sodium (Rubidium), Iris (Oculus) and many mods\n* Compatible with Minecraft's JSON font definition (bitmap fonts, TTF fonts)\n\nAdditionally, this Mod provides many utilities which improve game performance and gaming experience. Currently, we have:\n* Changing screen background color\n* Gaussian blur to screen backdrop image\n* Fade-in animation to screen background\n* More window modes: Fullscreen (borderless), Maximized (borderless)\n* Framerate limit and master volume fading on window inactive (out of focus) and minimized\n* Pausing single-player game when Inventory is open\n* Changing GUI scale option to Slider and providing hint text\n* Playing a \"Ding\" sound when Minecraft loads and reaches the Main Menu\n* Enabling smooth scrolling in Vanilla's Selection List and Forge's Scroll Panel\n* Pressing \"C\" to Zoom that is the same as OptiFine\n* Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) and Unicode grapheme/word iterator for all text fields\n* Playing local music, allowing to seek and view spectrum\n* Support Discord/Slack/GitHub/IamCal/JoyPixels emoji shortcodes in Chatting\n* A fancy tooltip style\n  + Choose rounded border or normal border (with shadow effect)\n  + Add title break and control title line spacing\n  + Auto line wrapping and auto vertical scrolling when out of screen\n  + Center the title line, support RTL layout direction\n  + Exactly position the tooltip to pixel grid (smooth movement)\n  + Change background color and border color (with gradient and animation)\n \n\n### Core Features:\n\n* 2D Graphics Library of Multiple Graphics APIs\n* Intermediate Representation and ASTs of Shading Languages\n* Symbolic distance function and vector graphics rendering\n* Image post-processing effects\n* Fast matrix and vector calculation\n* Image format conversion\n* Animation and transition framework\n* Event loop and multi-threading framework\n* Text shaping and complex text layout engine\n* MVVM and lifecycle handling\n* Automatic RTL (right-to-left) UI layout\n* Markdown (CommonMark) rendering support\n \n\n### Modern Text Engine for Minecraft:\n\n* Support color Emoji, use Google Noto Color Emoji 15.1, based on Unicode 15.1 Emoji list;\n* Support Emoji shortcodes in chat, for example :rofl: to rolling on the floor laughing, support Discord and Slack shortcodes;\n* You can use TTF or OTF fonts, configure the font base size, set the baseline shift, and set whether to drop text shadow;\n* Scalable vector graphics, automatic switching resolution level (up to 96px), native (non-synthetic) Bold and Italic rendering;\n* Supports distance field text rendering in 3D world, but sharpens font atlas in 2D GUI; This enhances a former feature:\n  *Render all characters smoothly on any scale (like when you're away from a sign, or a very small text in GUI)\n* Support multilayer text, layout multiple paragraphs together, streaming layout algorithm, and introduce fast layout cache;\n* Support fast digit replacement, high-precision layout and alignment, and smoothly draw fast changing digits (fixed width);\n* Support mip-mapping, anti-aliasing, linear sampling and supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA);\n* Better and more efficient layout of BiDi text paragraphs (e.g. Arabic, Yiddish); Use sharpen font atlases;\n* Configurable BiDi text heuristic algorithm to control text direction more accurately; Support to fix invalid surrogate pairs;\n* Use HarfBuzz text shaping, support combining characters rendering, like Thai, Devanagari, Bengali and Tamil;\n* Support grapheme cluster break, support Unicode line breaking algorithm;\n* Support context-aware and locale-based word break and line break;\n* Support pixelated font rendering, support fixed resolution level, support pixel alignment;\n* Support bitmap replacement, rendering smoothly for fast changing numbers, support emoji rendering;\n* Optimize the layout algorithm, increase your FPS by about 10% when drawing texts in GUI\n* Use grayscale pixels to store texture, reduce GPU memory usage\n* Reduce unnecessary RAM usage and greatly reduce object creation\n\n### Customize Fonts\nPress Ctrl+K or ⌘+K (by default) to open Action Center, go to Preferences, swipe the screen to the second page, and you will see Font settings.\n* Preferred font family is your most wanted one. It can be either an OS font or a TrueType/OpenType font (collection) file.\n* Fallback font families are used when the preferred font family is unavailable.\n\nModern Text Engine:  \nModern UI follows Minecraft's JSON font definition, only glyph provider type 'legacy_unicode' and 'unihex' are ignored. Modern UI font families mentioned above will serve as fallback font families for Minecraft fonts. Default Font Behavior (in Preferences > Text Layout) gives you an option to remove some glyph providers from the Minecraft default font (minecraft:default). To avoid using vanilla ASCII fonts, just set it to Keep Other. Note this option is only valid if you have not turned on Force Unicode Font. If you want to use vanilla Unicode font, just download the OTF version of [GNU Unifont](https://unifoundry.com/unifont/).\n\n### Additional Features for Minecraft:\n\n* Support setting window mode, such as fullscreen borderless, windowed borderless;\n* GUI screen background fade-in animation and 2-pass gaussian convolution blur effect, configurable background gradient color;\n* Smooth rounded tooltip style, support RTL layout, configurable background and border color;\n* Play a \"ding\" sound effect when the game is loaded;\n* Support pausing the game when your inventory is opened;\n* New GUI scale algorithm and slider GUI scale widget (not limited to even numbers, compatible with OptiFine);\n* Add smooth scrolling for vanilla and forge scrolling panels;\n* Async network handler; Server auto-shutdown;\n* All features are configurable in configs or Action Center screen (default shortkey Ctrl+K)\n\n### Modern UI for Fabric removed some features (compared to the Forge version):\n* OptiFine-like zoom, hide crosshairs in GUI\n* Dump more debugging information, crash report extension\n \n### Comparison with Caxton text rendering techniques\n[Caxton](https://modrinth.com/mod/caxton) mod is known for its MSDF text rendering, you can choose between Caxton and Modern Text Engine.   \n\nSimilarities:\n* Both use HarfBuzz text shaping\n* Both support Unicode text processing\n* Both support Unicode line breaking and grapheme cluster break\n* Both compatible with Iris in raster rendering mode\n* Both have an efficient rectangle packing algorithm, further better than Mojang's\n\nDifferences:\n* Caxton uses a newer HarfBuzz whereas we use a older one (bundled with JDK 17, it's updated in JDK 21)\n* Caxton uses multi-channel SDF and renders sharper scaling-up texts, whereas we render over-rounded\n* We are compatible with OptiFine, whereas Caxton isn't\n* We support color emoji, whereas Caxton doesn't\n* We support FreeType font hinting whereas Caxton never support it, font hinting helps on low-res monitor\n* We support perfect sampling of native glyph image in screen-space, this is ideal for 2D rendering\n* We support single-channel SDF text rendering without additional GPU resources, we always use 1bpp textures\n* We have smart SDF sampling method for scaling-down texts, whereas Caxton hasn't\n* No need to wait for MSDF texture generation, you can switch fonts in-game with just one click\n* We support various text direction heuristics and line break strategies\n* We don't use additional native libraries, so Modern UI works on macOS\n* We have a slightly higher layout performance than Caxton, and use less RAM\n\n### Mod Integration & Compatibility:\n\n#### Compatible (you should pay attention to):\n\nOptiFine, Sodium, Iris, Create, AoA3  \nIf Shaders are active, *Use Modern Text Shaders in 3D* is auto disabled, it will cause the outline of glowing text to become invisible.\n\n#### Mods with similar functions are replaced:\n\n* Blur (ver 1.15 ~ 1.20; reason: full functional coverage, better optimization)\n  + Blur mod claims to use Gaussian blur, but I found it actually uses 2-pass box blur. Whereas Modern UI gives you the true 1-pass Gaussian Blur, which is better than Blur mod.\n* Controlling (ver 1.15; reason: another way of implementation)\n* TipTheScales (ver 1.15 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Inventory Pause (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Emojiful (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: we support color emoji rendering since 3.5.0; additionally, Emojiful has really bad code and breaks your game everywhere; you may experience game freezing, high VRAM usage, rendering glitches, and many performance & mod compatibility issues)\n* Borderless Window (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Ding (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* SmoothScrollingEverywhere (ver 1.18 ~ 1.19; reason: another way of implementation)\n* FPS Reducer (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n\n\n#### Conflict and Solution:\n\n* Emojiful (ver 1.16 ~ 1.20; it's not recommended to use Emojiful; if you must use it,  disable Modern UI text engine, via config screen or bootstrap properties)\n* Legendary Tooltips (ver 1.16 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI tooltip, via config screen)\n* FeyTweaks (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable TextRendererMixin in FeyTweaks' mixin config)\n* SmoothScrollingEverywhere (ver 1.18 ~ 1.19; solution: disable Modern UI smooth scrolling, via config screen)\n* Caxton (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI text engine, via config screen or bootstrap properties)\n* ImmediatelyFast (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable ImmediatelyFast's hud_batching, font_atlas_resizing and fast_text_lookup; otherwise, you may experience random game crashes)\n* Untranslated Items (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI text component cache, via config screen)\n\n#### Supported MC versions:\n* Actively maintained: 1.20.4, 1.20.1, 1.19.4, 1.19.2\n* About to be dropped: 1.20.2, 1.20, 1.18.2, 1.18.1\n* No longer supported: 1.18, 1.17.1, 1.16.5, 1.16.4, 1.16.3, 1.16.2, 1.16.1, 1.15.2, 1.14.4\n\nAll descriptions on this page are for Minecraft 1.19.4 and above. Some features may be missing in older versions.\n\n#### PC Requirements (same as Minecraft Vanilla)\nSome people are unwilling to use Modern UI because they believe that Modern UI has a high PC requirements. In fact, as long as you can play Minecraft Vanilla, you can definitely play Modern UI. Unless you forget to update your GPU driver.\n* OS: Windows 8.1+, Linux with X11 or Wayland, macOS\n* Architecture: x64 or arm64\n* GPU: GeForce 210 or better\n* GPU Driver: OpenGL 3.3+ or Vulkan 1.1+, higher is better\n* Java: Java 17+, higher is better\n\n\n### FAQ:\n\n##### Q: What is the difference between Default Font Behavior and Force Unicode Font?\nA: Firstly, Modern UI always redirects Unicode font to Modern UI default typeface. Default Font Behavior is KEEP ALL in 1.19+, then Minecraft default font is used for ASCII characters. KEEP OTHER means that Minecraft default font is no longer used, but additional fonts, for example, in some minigame maps, are still available. This is the difference from Force Unicode Font (IGNORE ALL).\n\n##### Q: Does Modern UI have a high overhead? Will Modern UI lower application performance?\nA: No, Modern UI does not have a significant impact on CPU, GPU, RAM, and VRAM usage. This is because Modern UI itself has good optimization, but at the same time, Modern UI provides a bunch of new features and effects. Modern UI framework is known to be more efficient than Chromium-based applications.\nFor low-end PCs, screen blur effect may be a performance killer, because Minecraft Vanilla does not allow mipmap generation on render targets. Even so, the blur effect provided by Modern UI is much faster than a mod called 'Blur'.\n\n##### Q: How to disable all changes to vanilla, I don't want these features.\nA: Only GUI scale algorithm and some low-level code are non-configurable, any other features can be disabled in Action Center screen (shortkey Ctrl+K by default), or config files (gameDir/config/ModernUI/), because Modern UI is essentially a framework.\n\n##### Q: Is this mod a client-only mod? Do I need to install it on the server?\nA: Since MC 1.19.2, there is no reason to install this mod on the server anymore. All server features are deprecated and implemented to Forge API and Fabric API.\n\n##### Q: How to get start to develop my mod based on Modern UI?\nA: This project is still in early stages, the specification is still being written. You can view the [JavaDoc](https://blocamlimb.github.io/ModernUI/javadoc/). Examples include Modern UI itself (Action Center) and Flux Networks.

Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-05-16T18:29:48.419704Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3406868,"followers":3481,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"48hFxWw7","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.3","version_number":"3.4.3","changelog":"Changes:\n\n-

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2024-03-11T04:25:33.406050Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1201499,"followers":1013,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff","AHxQGtuC","7aQD4OG8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"7aQD4OG8","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.8.1","version_number":"3.8.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-11T04:25:33.849002Z","downloads":29990,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"42c66bd280f5030bafc50f5e9a6e4bacda10e0d717903a03448013d86ba373718bce0f3550e653043eb2e4bae4334557f234b621801a4b84bf59f1e9dd579447","sha1":"7c784b0c479eb91d43314c00348a7750197af8f9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/7aQD4OG8/trinkets-3.8.1.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.8.1.jar","primary":true,"size":240884,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":"Emi","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"trinkets-3.8.1.jar"},"mods\\appleskin-fabric-mc1.20.3-2.5.1.jar":{"sha512":"d121c5b760da0df1882f74bedfe84f2033d81a679cb0aa15e38eeae5fefefba8b23b1a87e43095c3cb9cbde5d0960b52d99856209111069923078c39c8750aa6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"EsAfCjCV","slug":"appleskin","project_type":"mod","team":"2RI7njA8","title":"AppleSkin","description":"Food/hunger-related HUD improvements","body":"Adds various food-related HUD improvements.

quality. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-04-29T16:00:45.150007Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":10218538,"followers":13159,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.8","version_number":"mc1.20.4-0.5.8","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Fabric API 0.95.3+ when using High Contrast or Programmer Art resource packs.\n- Improved support for keyboard accessibility features in parts of the video settings screen.

It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20. Starlight and Vanilla are close enough on 1.20 that\nthis test is also useless.\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZQx7Ek0.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/MrA2PQk.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")\n\nPerformance for 1.19.4 and below:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png \"Light engine time chunk generation Graph\")\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")","published":"2021-08-29T14:08:31.790201Z","updated":"2023-12-10T20:26:57.476791Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2918671,"followers":4123,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["nc7qGadJ","p26lbcyI","4ew9whL8","zFqBnsxO","qH1xCwoC","XGIsoVGT","98VOoYPX","PLbxwptm","1QrtjfDy","HZYU0kdg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H8CaAYZC/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"HZYU0kdg","project_id":"H8CaAYZC","author_id":"fYyU5YhM","featured":true,"name":"Starlight 1.1.3 1.20.4 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.1.3+1.20.4","changelog":"Update to 1.20.4\n - only needed to bump compatible version","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-10T20:27:20.093181Z","downloads":284259,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"6c1dfb43aa2873ecf474b3278d42348457fbca0f","sha512":"6bc9e4582f6e28dada721cd5a3eea5b817e3445883a3717c1927c558ee991dc327239c62afd4ce9215fa7735c3afa6e870f287826dc4c2d773a524903a7b8fb4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H8CaAYZC/versions/HZYU0kdg/starlight-1.1.3%2Bfabric.f5dcd1a.jar","filename":"starlight-1.1.3+fabric.f5dcd1a.jar","primary":true,"size":126410,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DXoc0ko3","user":{"id":"fYyU5YhM","username":"spottedleaf","name":"Spottedleaf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6100722?v=4","bio":"Developer of Folia, Starlight & Paper.","created":"2021-08-29T13:50:25.716250Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"starlight-1.1.3+fabric.f5dcd1a.jar"},"mods\\ForgeConfigAPIPort-v20.4.3-1.20.4-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"d1eb1bc1aad0bcd3d97deee3d8f3b3eeaa43c332697be043260b7af132c7ee3da6c8b35f635ef7e4a431a95fa6f13dd4a796badeba91bba2b67eff6dc855d8e5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ohNO6lps","slug":"forge-config-api-port","project_type":"mod","team":"Lcr15WUK","title":"Forge Config API Port","description":"NeoForge's & Forge's config systems provided to other modding ecosystems.

[Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v20.4.3-1.20.4] - 2024-01-22\n### Fixed\n- Fix `mods.toml` entries for NeoForge\n\n## [v20.4.2-1.20.4] - 2024-01-13\n### Changed\n- Implement `UnmodifiableConfigWrapper` for `IConfigSpec` adapters on NeoForge & Forge\n\n## [v20.4.1-1.20.4] - 2024-01-10\n- Huge internal restructure, including new publications for NeoForge (for using Forge configs) and Forge (for using NeoForge configs)\n- The Fabric publication still includes all classes for both config systems, the api package has been split from `fuzs.forgeconfigapiport.api.config` into `fuzs.forgeconfigapiport.fabric.api.forge` and `fuzs.forgeconfigapiport.fabric.api.neoforge`\n- The common module is no longer published as `forgeconfigapiport-common`, instead there are now two common publications which are `forgeconfigapiport-common-forgeapi` and `forgeconfigapiport-common-neoforgeapi`\n### Added\n- Added `disableConfigWatcher` config option to both `ForgeConfigSpec` and `ModConfigSpec`\n### Changed\n- Updated ForgeConfigSpec with changes from [MinecraftForge#9810](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/9810)\n### Fixed\n- Fixed `FileWatcher` hanging due to an invalid path when unloading server configs\n\n## [v20.4.0-1.20.4] - 2023-12-21\n- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.4 (thanks to [Girafi](https://github.com/GirafiStudios) for helping out!)\n- The mod version now is more streamlined by including the targeted Minecraft version (e.g. Minecraft 1.20.4 -> Mod Version 20.4.X)\n\n[Keep a Changelog]:

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you.

Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure.

I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work.

[Curseforge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/debugify) • [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/debugify) • [Patched bug list](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/blob/1.19/PATCHED.md) • [Discord](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?\nDebugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n- [**isXander**](https://github.com/isXander) - Founder of project\n- [**Contributors**](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/graphs/contributors) - For PRing new fixes!\n- [**MoonTidez**](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Creating an awesome logo!\n\n### Translators\n- [**RaptaG**](https://github.com/RaptaG) - Greek\n- [**Altegar**](https://github.com/Altegar) - Ukrainian\n- [**ttrafford7**](https://github.com/ttrafford7) - Ukrainian\n- [**GodGun968**](https://github.com/GodGun968) - Chinese\n- [**Agentew04**](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Portuguese\n- [**localfossa**](https://github.com/localfossa) - Turkish\n- [**xMikux**](https://github.com/xMikux) - Traditional Chinese\n","published":"2022-03-17T20:44:31.607662Z","updated":"2024-05-06T15:58:47.570542Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2207107,"followers":1623,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["d1wGDnOg","rvmKzdit","lFcWshUo","nDA4zR8b","bDJ6C3ee","YToHBCxz","SL7w72eH","phRoW4cz","XcwsnmsZ","1pnb6cGl","fX9fSRpc","D3InZWhh","NR1MuP9t","ez77o4vP","ZSOeDjPU","rlPcRBXm","nElg9xeo","J3zRK5bi","FatqexKs","tWRyPcFL","NDu88Zwa","hY3DKYio","aOxCEP3D","CSWmF24f","pPFCiLjA","BCj6Z3cx","TCs1cNbH","7WXEKPNx","Tk0RAQMD","rKzPCLMb","jlIRKhk7","m21FBC92","XtJaW95T","ltSWiXrH","jxiMbq1j","GeIPOMAw","IWgfkuO9","vgor1UDw","h7UENtbi","BmkonV8u","LVTec1Rh","US297WEJ","7nWg7CpV","2CSuLT5g","4J87zok9","11cqAA0W","1Wc2PZ7G","IhcW4hp4","jl2bfULg","qGM9M0wh","9xvnFOIg","KB2xqwsT","W2UIVXCp","SCJtEeya","HdzIkYvh","pYAlD9TK","UvBWAMZL","l8A2i9nV","fgjgGIfI","GtD9tAHh","v2s5aT84","CQP9o8LS","oevI3RPR","jskCDMsk","l6S5WIlU","7SaNcvDx","6ckEWNPu","GTuKuQLA","6XDJoCks","ZSI78Xd3","pfPFUzJF","vJOKWGcy","gGTvKKDk","aQYNRsGo","abm18PGR","wJlrMn2x"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QwxR6Gcd/d1db8e74a5ad29908bd011ce271145cea349cd13.png"},"version":{"id":"aQYNRsGo","project_id":"QwxR6Gcd","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"1.20.4+1.1 (1.20.4)","version_number":"1.20.4+1.1","changelog":"[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n\n- Fix broken description cache\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-31T20:31:49.052492Z","downloads":159514,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"248cd69236eed33faca6a08c4ba535c7249a0528","sha512":"acfc53fb695196275745c0134b45cfac5c8414a2446b86955078e469f9603f74dc940c5483385277cd74db110f7852d09822a31301c31cb273d3831eb8ab13ab"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QwxR6Gcd/versions/aQYNRsGo/Debugify-1.20.4%2B1.1.jar","filename":"Debugify-1.20.4+1.1.jar","primary":true,"size":270096,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ArPsDJdJ","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Debugify-1.20.4+1.1.jar"},"mods\\biome_replacer-1.2.jar":{"sha512":"c2e646040ac03c4ca793a35a1c537a65a5993ca0992fcde610f7852fa8d185444998101e494676a05cefb6be524a03216031368ef0d54fd82fe958ac18313909","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"DAXbR0Wj","slug":"biome-replacer","project_type":"mod","team":"yaYpy4Kc","title":"Biome Replacer","description":"A quick way to get rid of a biome. Useful for tweaking datapack-based generators (like Terralith) that don't have a convenient configuration","body":"\n\nSmall mod that replaces one biome with another, without affecting other parts of the generation. \nUseful for preventing certain datapack biomes from generating, fixing modded biomes \nnot appearing, or polishing up that almost-perfect seed.\n\nConfiguration is very simple. \nFind `biome-replacer.properties` in your configuration folder, and put replacement rules in the format\n`old_biome > new_biome`. You can find some examples below.\n\nWorks fully server-side.\n\nNote that this mod is intended mostly for replacing vanilla and datapack biomes.\n**Biomes added using libraries like TerraBlender or Biolith cannot be replaced**; \nyou should use the mod's config to tweak or remove them instead.  \nThat said, this mod can safely be used alongside these libraries, \nand it's even possible to replace vanilla/datapack biomes *with* modded ones.\n\n## Examples\n\nA case with vanilla biomes. This is what configuration file looks like:\n```\nminecraft:dark_forest > minecraft:cherry_grove\n```\nAnd here's how the world looks, before and after:\n![Dark forest is replaced by a cherry grove](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WerDei/Biome-Replacer/master/readme-files/example-1.png)\n\nWhen using Terralith, Lavender Plains biome from Aurora's Decorations won't generate. \nHere's how we can fix it:\n```\nterralith:lavender_forest > aurorasdeco:lavender_plains\nterralith:lavender_valley > aurorasdeco:lavender_plains\n```\n![Lavender Forest is replaced by Lavender Plains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WerDei/Biome-Replacer/master/readme-files/example-2.png)\n![Same area, but from a higher perspective](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WerDei/Biome-Replacer/master/readme-files/example-3.png)\n\nSpiders are yucky.

with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric.

usage optimizations","body":"This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-05-01T06:08:18.836384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":5206652,"followers":5070,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"pguEMpy9","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.3 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.3-fabric","changelog":"- Update to Minecraft 1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-13T09:52:24.527613Z","downloads":839768,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f2bbb773f4213d36201b76820f206e2a6f213c0c","sha512":"709ab6362dd1dcc432edd1e6c33aafba6f2d12be701bc14911107340f8ac2466779c4e57d8a303f0350c46478f23008e6eeca78e4eadedd0bdee63d4ae72ed9a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/pguEMpy9/ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125100,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar"},"mods\\cloth-config-13.0.121-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"05a389ce4383c7b202e6aa7b37f39da01b6ee1f5b22dad076d528891b5ef8bcae335b2d7930b33b753ad34f1a61bae52f3447f74a4df6739239344674b59b0c5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"9s6osm5g","slug":"cloth-config","project_type":"mod","team":"z9omIQMN","title":"Cloth Config API","description":"Configuration Library for Minecraft Mods","body":"[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZEORx0F.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\"/>](https://discord.gg/Vs9AVkxjYY) [<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LrVLC2a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\"/>](https://www.patreon.com/shedaniel)\n\nCloth Config API is a config screen api.\n\n### Developers Wiki\n[https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/](https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/)\n\nNeed a server to play with friends?

Chests now will have more variated loot, and not the same expected loot over and over.\n♦ All small ruins now will generate more frequently, makes the ocean more alive and less boring to explore.\n♦ Added a little small potencial to drowned farms in the underwater city structure, some normal vanilla drowned will spawn around the city.\n♦ Speaking of underwater cities, improved the way of how these generate, making them a little bit more deep that before, this new generation might be look similar to how we see ancient cities.\n♦ Added some death corals around the city.\n♦ New arrow effect.\n♦ Improved drowneds AI (only drowneds that are part of the city), now they will know when exactly atack, and not every single one of them will track you in the same time, this change makes cities more consistent and to be fair, it was really weird see all those drowndes tracking you in the same time.\n♦ Added some more decorated pots around the city.\n♦ Credits to all the creators of

mod.\n\n</center>\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod prevents campfires from creating any particles when certain blocks are underneath them. It affects both standard and soul campfires. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is to prevent client-side lag and general annoyance when using large numbers of campfires in farms. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is a client-side mod, it will have no effect if installed on a dedicated server.\n\n<br />\n\nThe default list of blocks that suppress smoke is:\n```json\n\"suppressing_blocks_list\": [\n  \"minecraft:hopper\",\n  \"minecraft:rail\",\n  \"minecraft:activator_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:powered_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:detector_rail\"\n]\n```\n\n<br />\n\nBlocks can be added and removed either using [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) or by editing '.minecraft/config/smoke_suppression.json'\n\n<br />\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Translating</summary>\n\nIf you'd like to translate Smoke Suppression (there are only a few lines of text), follow [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/smoke-suppression/invite/). \n\nNew translations will be added once approved without the mod needing an update thanks to [CrowdinTranslate](https://github.com/gbl/CrowdinTranslate).\n\n</details>\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric (works on Quilt, too!) and I won't be porting it to Forge.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-05-17T22:00:54.304528Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6074016,"followers":4935,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"7JR5qJ8f","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.4-1.20.4 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.4-1.20.4","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Fix culling when the camera is stuck in a wall.

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

various treasure items that can be found through exploration","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochotonida/artifacts/1.18/src/main/resources/logo.png)\n\nSome older versions of this mod can be found on curseforge: [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts) /  [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts-fabric)\n\nArtifacts is a mod which aims to make exploration more rewarding by adding various powerful items that cannot be crafted.\n\nThe items added by this mod can be found in chests in vanilla structures, through archaeology, or can very rarely be found worn by entities. All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items and their descriptions can be found in the images tab. Sn up-to-date list of where each item can be found is available on the wiki on GitHub.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack. Information about the data formats used can be found on the [Trinkets wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Trinkets-Data-Formats).\n\n#### _Which mod are you using to put artifacts on armor stands?_\n\n[Curious Armor Stands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curious-armor-stands \"\").\n\n#### _Can I still find artifacts if I add this mod to a world that has already been generated?_\n\nCampsites and mimics will only spawn in chunks that were generated after you downloaded the mod.

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3006598,"followers":3567,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.
